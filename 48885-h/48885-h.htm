<h2><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I.</a></h2>


<p>Mrs. de Barryos sat beside a window overlooking
a dainty rose-garden, the golden sunshine
streaming over her, the balmly air lifting the soft
curls of dark hair that was artistically touched
with gray. Her hands were folded idly over a
letter that lay in her lap&mdash;small hands that looked
as if they had never known the meaning of toil,
they were pale and thin, like the face of the woman
to whom they belonged, for Mrs. de Barryos was
an invalid.</p>

<p>She had been pretty before her face acquired
its present angles through suffering; never beautiful,
but pretty in a dainty, meaningless sort of
way; inoffensively pretty some people might have
called her, for there was no strength in it, nor
character. Her eyes were innocent, wide-open
brown ones that were like those of an obedient
child. Her chin was decidedly weak, and about
the mouth had grown with her age a sort of querulous
tremble, as if she felt that the world had
used her unfairly, and wanted all mankind to
sympathize with and pet her because of it.</p>

<p>She was never known to miss an opportunity to
tell people of all the wretchedness that had been
so bravely and uncomplainingly borne. She had
fancied for the past five years that death was imminent,
that its shadows lay across her threshold,
and yet she was apparently as far from it as she
had been at the beginning of the five years.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span></p>

<p>There was another thing about Mrs. de Barryos'
life of which she was apparently as proud as of
her illness and patience, and that was the fact
that she was a lineal descendant of the renowned
Pocahontas, a fact at which some people laughed;
but it was an undisputed fact, all the same, for the
historical Indian maiden had given birth to one of
the grandfathers upon the maternal side, and the
curling hair and weakness of character had been inherited
from the branch of the family that should
have imparted its strength.</p>

<p>And it was of that same ancestress that Mrs.
de Barryos was thinking as she sat there beside
the window, her eyes mechanically following the
flitting movements of a graceful form in the garden
that was bending above the roses.</p>

<p>And surely the girl was beautiful enough to
look upon.</p>

<p>It might have been easy enough to believe that
there was the blood of an Indian flowing through
her veins, for the clear olive complexion, the inky
blackness of the hair, which still was not straight,
the touch of crimson in the cheeks, and the great
velvet eyes might have indicated it. There was
a better explanation of it, however, in the fact
that her father was a Mexican.</p>

<p>After a little she came toward the window at
which her mother sat, her arms filled with the
lovely crimson blossoms that fitted her dusky
beauty so royally, and seated herself upon the sill
of the window, dropping the roses about her
in gorgeous profusion as she prepared to bind
them into a bouquet.</p>

<p>"Aren't they exquisite?" she asked, admiringly,
her voice a full, rich contralto that made music
even of the most ordinary speech. "It seems to
me that I never saw them so fine before."</p>

<p>"I wish you would put them away!" exclaimed
her mother, querulously. "It seems to me, Carlita,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
that you are always working among the flowers,
and that I never get a moment in which to
speak to you."</p>

<p>The girl threw one swift glance of blended astonishment
and reproach in her mother's direction,
then rose quietly, gathered up her flowers, entered
the room, and placed them upon a table, then drew
a stool to her mother's feet and sat upon it.</p>

<p>"I am awfully sorry if I have neglected you,
dearest," she said, gently. "Was there anything
special that you wanted to speak to me about?"</p>

<p>"Yes, there is," returned the plaintive voice.
"There is something I want to tell you. I have
just had a letter from&mdash;from Jessica."</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I wrote to her mother the other day. I
know you don't like me to be making preparations
for my death, Carlita, but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, mother!"</p>

<p>"Well, what is a woman to do when she sees
death staring her in the face and no one will believe
it?" cried the woman, fretfully. "I wanted
to make some provision for you, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"My dear, my dear, if you knew how this pains
me, I am sure&mdash;"</p>

<p>"If I don't know, it isn't because you haven't
told me often enough, Heaven knows!" exclaimed
Mrs. de Barryos, with irritation. "You never
think of any one but yourself, Carlita."</p>

<p>For a moment it seemed as if the girl were about
to utter a protest; then she thought better of it,
and contented herself with a little gesture of
deprecation and silence.</p>

<p>After a brief hesitation, her mother continued
more quietly, soothed, perhaps, by her daughter's
submission:</p>

<p>"Your Aunt Erminie and I never agreed, and so
I knew that you would not desire to live there at
my death, and so I have written to Jessica's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
mother, who was my old school friend, asking if
I might appoint her your guardian. She has
written today, through Jessica, to say that she
will be very happy to accept the trust. I have
not seen Louise for a very great many years; but
I have always loved her, and I am quite sure
that she will be kind to my little motherless
girl."</p>

<p>"Oh, mother! Why will you persist in saying
such dreadful things?"</p>

<p>"Because I know the end is not far off, my dear,
and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You have said that same thing for five
years."</p>

<p>"Then the end is five years nearer. I never can
have any satisfaction in talking to you, Carlita.
You won't sit down and reason a thing out, as
other people do."</p>

<p>The girl leaned her exquisite face upon her hand
and looked dreamily through the window.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon," she said, softly. "I will
not interrupt again."</p>

<p>"I feel so satisfied," her mother continued,
spreading out her hands curiously; "now that
Louise has undertaken your guardianship, I can
die quite contented. You will have Jessica for a
companion, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I have never seen Jessica or her mother."</p>

<p>"There you go again! What difference can that
possibly make? Louise and I were the greatest
friends as girls. I shall never forget how she cried
when I told her that I was going to marry your
father.</p>

<p>"'My dear Dorindah,' she said, 'you will regret
it to the last day of your life. Jose de Barryos is a
hot-tempered Mexican, and you know how dreadful
they are.'</p>

<p>"It was quite true, Carlita. I never knew a moment's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
happiness from the time I married your
father until the day he died."</p>

<p>The girl moved restlessly; there was intense
pain depicted in her countenance; but her mother
continued as if she had not observed:</p>

<p>"He ruined my life, made me the wreck that I
am&mdash;I, who was called one of the greatest beauties
of my day. I was never happy for a single moment
after I became his wife; but that is only what
I might have expected from the curse that rests
upon me."</p>

<p>"The curse that rests upon you?" returned Carlita,
looking at her mother for the first time with a
dawning interest. "Why, what curse rests upon
you?"</p>

<p>"It is that about which I wanted to talk to you,
that about which I wanted to tell you. My poor
child, when you go into the world, at my death,
you will go with the same curse upon you that has
spoiled my life, and that must wreck yours."</p>

<p>"Mother, what do you mean?" asked Carlita.</p>

<p>"It is a curse of Pocahontas, child&mdash;the curse
that falls, from generation to generation, upon one
girl child who shows the trace of the Indian, and
you are that one! I was the one of my generation,
you of yours."</p>

<p>"Mother, you are jesting."</p>

<p>"I am in most deadly earnest, Carlita. You
know that we are descendants of Pocahontas. She
married a white man&mdash;John Rolf, if you remember&mdash;and
died a broken-hearted woman. She left one
son, and upon her death-bed she pronounced a
curse&mdash;a curse that has never failed to fall. It was
that one girl descendant of each generation should
suffer, through her love, even as she had suffered.
It was that she should know no happiness; that if
she dared to love, the most bitter misery should
fall upon her and the man of her choice. And the
curse has never failed, Carlita. It has never failed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
and it never can fail. Think! You have heard the
story of how, when your great-aunt and uncle were
coming from their wedding, the skiff in which they
were crossing the river capsized, and all within it
were drowned&mdash;six of them! Your great-grandmother
went mad, and died a raving maniac, when
her husband was killed right before her eyes. Your
grandmother died of a broken heart when her husband
wandered away, and no one ever knew
whether the Indians killed him, or he simply deserted
her. He was never heard of afterward.
Your mother's pitiful history you know well
enough; it needs no repetition. I want you to
know all this, and that the curse has descended to
you, in order that you may escape the misery and
heartache that has fallen upon the others of your
race. If you would save yourself from suffering
and death, you must never love!"</p>

<p>The girl sprang to her feet, the crimson color
passionately staining her cheeks.</p>

<p>"Mother!" she cried, hotly, "what are you
saying? Would you rob a young life of all that
makes it worth the living? Would you make of
me a hermit, shunning the whole world, and
shunned in turn? Would you deprive me of that
sentiment for which God created me woman?"</p>

<p>The invalid stretched out her hands again deprecatingly.</p>

<p>"I have only told you the truth," she said, without
the slightest compassion for her daughter's suffering,
because she could not understand it. "I
have warned you and done my duty. I shall not be
here to look after you and protect you, and all that
I can do is to warn you. The truth stands there, and
you must recognize it. If you love, if you wed, you
will not only ruin your own life, but that of the
man who tempts you to marriage. You have that
to keep before you always&mdash;always. If I had done
it I should not be the wreck I am today; but I had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
no one to warn me against the fate I was preparing
for myself. Just keep these words ever
fresh within your memory, and you will be safe:
'The curse of Pocahontas rests upon me!'"</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II.</a></h2>


<p>Shortly after that, to the surprise of everybody,
Mrs. de Barryos did die.</p>

<p>People had expected that she was going to be
one of those who lived eternally, eternally complaining,
and her death came in the nature of a
sort of shock to the community. Carlita was
looked upon with general favor, and there were
those who, while they sighed, exclaimed to each
other consolingly:</p>

<p>"Well it is the first freedom of any sort the poor
child ever had. She will grieve, of course, but as
soon as the first shock has worn off, she'll be happier
than she ever was in her life before."</p>

<p>But any kind of a mother is better than no
mother at all, and there was the sincerest sorrow
in Carlita's heart. There was enough of the warm
Mexican blood in her veins to fill her with a passion
that was beyond the understanding of those colder,
more northern folk, and she had loved her mother
very sincerely. She was frightened, too, at the
time of her mother's death by the remembrance
of that curse which her mother had impressed
upon her many times before the end came, and
felt that shrinking sense of loneliness, of bitter
oppression, of isolation from all the world that is
so hard to bear.</p>

<p>When Jose de Barryos died he left his fortune,
and it was considerable, equally to his wife and
daughter, the daughter under her guardianship and
that of a brother who did not long survive him,
so that at the time of Mrs. de Barryos' death
there was considerable interest felt as to who she
had appointed guardian of her daughter in her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
own place, Carlita being still under legal age.
Some said that she would appoint her husband's
sister, Mrs. Erminie Blanchard but there were
others who knew that there had not been sufficient
friendship between the two women for that, and
there was a rustle of excitement felt when two
ladies in mourning arrived on the day of the
funeral, two women whom none of them had ever
seen before, but who went at once to the great
de Barryos mansion, for it was nothing less in
that country, and established themselves in the
house.</p>

<p>There was considerable talk among the neighbors,
who stood off and looked at them from a distance
like frightened sheep, feeling somehow an
embarrassment that they were never known to exhibit
before.</p>

<p>Both of them were large women, the elder inclined
to be stout, with a waist that was suspiciously
small for the size of bust and hips. Her
hair was yellow&mdash;a brilliant, half-greenish yellow&mdash;that
contrasted oddly with her very dark eyebrows
and black lashes. Her eyes were a dark blue, and
her complexion very white and very pink about
the cheeks.</p>

<p>She was startlingly young-looking to confess to
being the mother of the young woman who accompanied
her.</p>

<p>She&mdash;the daughter&mdash;was a curious contrast to her
mother, while following at the same time upon
much the same lines. Her hair was red&mdash;that
glorious dark rich auburn&mdash;her eyes dark brown
and rather fine, her complexion singularly like
that of her mother. She was not beautiful&mdash;not
even pretty&mdash;but there was a certain sort of
dangerous fascination about her that even inexperienced
people recognized.</p>

<p>Carlita rather gasped when they bore down upon
her suddenly the day of her mother's funeral<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>,
their mourning was so heavy, so crisp, so new, and
they gushed over her in such a curious way, calling
her "a dear thing!" "darling!" and all the rest of
it, which was quite new to Carlita, and they took
such absolute possession of everything. But she
explained it all to herself by remembering that
letter which her mother had received signed "Jessica,"
and tried to be satisfied.</p>

<p>When the will was read, the good people understood
it all better.</p>

<p>Mrs. Louise Chalmers has been appointed guardian
of the orphaned heiress, and Mrs. Louise
Chalmers was that rather large, rather showy,
rather overdressed, while yet in mourning, woman,
and to her had been left an income of eight thousand
dollars a year so long as she remained Carlita's
guardian.</p>

<p>Her black-bordered handkerchief was pressed
very closely to her eyes during the reading of the
will; but although an occasional sob was heard by
those who sat nearest to her, there wasn't an atom
of moisture on the handkerchief when it was removed.
Her little, black King Charles spaniel
fidgeted and sneezed on her lap during the entire
time, not quite able to comprehend why he should
be neglected for the first time in all his absurdly
spoiled life.</p>

<p>It did not seem quite appropriate to those plain
Southern folks that Mrs. Chalmers should hold a
dog on her lap during the reading of her old
friend's will; but they rather forgave her when
she went up to Carlita, and, in a really very pretty
way, put her arms about the young orphan's neck,
and said in her sweetest and most maternal voice:</p>

<p>"I can not take your mother's place, my darling,
but I shall try to be a second one to you. It is
a very sacred trust that she has left me, and I
shall try with all my heart to be worthy of it."</p>

<p>And she immediately took the place of "second<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
mother," taking the direction of everything in her
own hands with a clear sweep that rather staggered
Carlita. Her mother had been ill for five
years before her death, as has already been told,
and the girl had been housekeeper in entire charge,
so that to be so completely swept aside in her own
domain was something which she had not calculated
upon. Still, she submitted, because there
did not seem to be anything else to be done.</p>

<p>There were not many changes made in the house,
because practically there was no way of making
them. The town was not full of opportunities.
The people were slow and inactive. Jose de Barryos
had owned a huge cotton plantation just
outside the limits of the town, and had been contented
to have his dwelling-place there, though
it must be confessed that he had not spent much
of his time at home. He and his wife had not
agreed sufficiently well to permit their living very
comfortably under the same roof for any length
of time together. And she had remained there
after his death because she lacked the energy to
do anything else.</p>

<p>But it was not the sort of place in which Mrs.
Chalmers could be long content. She was not
surprised, as she sat one evening upon the lawn
near the fountain, with the sweet southern air blowing
lazily about her, to receive a visit from her
daughter.</p>

<p>The girl threw herself upon the grass and looked
up indolently.</p>

<p>"I say," she exclaimed in a tone that was low,
almost thrilling, "this is dead slow! And I am
tired of the whole thing. I don't think I could
stand it another week for all the fortune that black
thing possesses!"</p>

<p>"Jessica!"</p>

<p>"Oh, bah! You are doing the delicately virtuous
with a vengeance, and it is that which adds to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
my ennui almost more than this enervating atmosphere.
Call a halt, can't you? One can't speak
of that little backwoods thing but you are up in
arms!"</p>

<p>"She is beautiful!"</p>

<p>"Yes; but with about as much style as one of
these buzzards that are so disgustingly plentiful.
Her big eyes are uncanny, and that chalky complexion
looks like the first indication of decay. She
looks like one of the mulatto girls that abound in
these parts. I am seriously afraid that some one
will think that we've brought a negro home with
us!"</p>

<p>"Jessica, for the love of Heaven, hush! If she
should hear you, she would never forgive you in
the world!"</p>

<p>"And what an awful calamity that would be!"
sneered the girl, gracefully drawing a blade of
long grass through her lips. "This place will be
good enough when this absurd time of mourning
is passed and we can fill it with guests; but until
it is, for the Lord's sake, let's cut it all and run.
I can't stand it!"</p>

<p>"We can't leave her."</p>

<p>"Of course, we can't&mdash;worse luck&mdash;but surely
you have not lost your cunning in the development
of romance. You can make her see the absolute
necessity for change of air and scene. You don't
need a better ally than that chalky complexion of
hers. Get me out of it, or I shall do something
disgraceful."</p>

<p>"Where shall we go?"</p>

<p>"Anywhere. I suppose we've got to draw it
mild on her pocket-book for a while; but&mdash;well,
the opera season has opened in New York, and
there will be something to live for. After that,
we can go over the pond for a while and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Why don't you try to use a little less slang,
Jessica?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span></p>

<p>"Because slang is strictly in my line, Miss Virtuous.
Look here! It is quite sufficient to be on
my p's and q's when our little mulatto is around,
without getting qualms and&mdash;and things. I say,
when are you going to propose the New York
plan?"</p>

<p>"You really think it best?"</p>

<p>"Best or worst, it's going to be done. Great
Scott! think of it! We've been buried in this hole
for three weeks now. Not a glass of champagne,
not the face of a man, not a single game of poker&mdash;nothing
to relieve the dread monotony. I'd be
in a mad-house in three weeks more! Besides all
that, I'm dead tired of this black toggery."</p>

<p>"You mean to take it off when you get back
to New York?"</p>

<p>"Take it off!" echoed the young lady, looking
up in astonishment. "Well, rather!"</p>

<p>"What will Carlita think?"</p>

<p>"What, in Heaven's name, do you suppose I
care what she thinks? Did you really believe that
I intend to pass the rest of my life guarded from
evil by the fear of Carlita's displeasure? If such
an idea has ever disturbed you, put it away at
once. She will very soon find her level in my life,
and in yours, if I mistake not. When will you
speak to her about our going?"</p>

<p>"Tomorrow, if you really wish it."</p>

<p>"You'd better make it tonight. There is no
time like the present. I shall sleep better if I
know the matter is settled."</p>

<p>"And if she should refuse?"</p>

<p>The girl lifted herself upon her elbow and
opened her eyes very wide.</p>

<p>"Refuse!" she exclaimed. "Heavens and earth!
Whence did you acquire this new-born submission?
I'm positively afraid the mulatto is affecting your
brain. Is she your guardian, or are you hers? Go
in there and tell her that you are going, and that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
she is going with you. It is quite enough. Just
let that settle it. Don't begin with anything like
questioning her inclination, or you may have cause
to regret it by and by. Come, toddle along now,
and I will wait for you here."</p>

<p>The girl lay indolently back upon the grass, and
her mother arose, albeit with a sigh.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III</a></h2>


<p>"Thank Heaven for New York once again, to
be free, to breathe without the suffocation of those
black things clinging about me, to get under the
bracing air of a Northern climate once more. I
wonder if you could command or persuade Carlita
to leave off that dreadful placard of woe and let
us have a little music and laughter once again?"</p>

<p>Jessica Chalmers threw herself into an arm-chair,
crossed her knees upon each other, lifted her dainty
foot to a graceful angle, and glanced up at her
mother with a smile upon her lips that was really
very pleasant to look at. She wore a negligee of
pale blue and silver that became her wonderfully
well, and there was an expression of fond admiration
in the eyes of the mother that returned her
smile.</p>

<p>"I don't think I would undertake it if I were
you," she replied, thoughtfully. "After all, it can
make very little difference to you. I am not anxious
that Carlita should go much into society, as
if she marries before she reaches the age of twenty-one
I shall be docked just eight thousand a year.
It isn't a fortune, I grant you, but it is a tidy little
sum for pin money. I think you have been rather
blind to the fact that Carlita is an exceptionally
beautiful girl, and&mdash;and&mdash;"</p>

<p>She did not complete her sentence, and Jessica
shrugged her shoulders indifferently.</p>

<p>"She is welcome to it," she answered, indolently.
"You know that is one thing I never envied any
one in my life. On the contrary, I think it must
be rather a bore to be continually thinking of it
and fearing to lose it. It is style that tells&mdash;chic&mdash;and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
Carlita hasn't an atom of that. Don't fear;
I shall not be in the least jealous of your pretty
protege. She and I are as far apart as the antipodes.
She is the most utterly namby-pamby
little nonentity that I have ever met."</p>

<p>Mrs. Chalmers turned away and walked toward
the window, looking down into Fifth Avenue. She
was silent for a moment, then, with her lips set
curiously, answered slowly:</p>

<p>"If she is, it will be the first half-breed Mexican
and Indian that I ever knew to be either a nonentity
or namby-pambyish. You may be right,
my dear Jessica, but you will pardon me, I know,
if I say that I don't believe it."</p>

<p>A reply was prevented by the entrance of a
maid bearing a card. She did not take it to the
mistress of the house, but straight to Jessica, who
looked at it, then sprang to her feet with a little
exclamation of delight.</p>

<p>"Leith Pierrepont, by all that's wonderful, and
so soon!" she cried. "Show him in, Marie!"</p>

<p>But almost before the order had been given a
young man entered the room. He was tall, singularly
handsome, with the bearing of a West
Pointer. His eyes were a deep, luminous gray,
shaded by lashes and brows that were black. His
hair was also black, with a suggestion of a wave
in it that was exceedingly attractive. It was
brushed away from a brow as fair and smooth as
a girl's, but there was no weakness in the face. Its
strength was one of its greatest attractions, but it
was not in the least in harmony with the indolence
of his movements, the careless, nonchalant
grace of his speech.</p>

<p>People said of him that he had never been in a
hurry in his life, but certainly no one ever accused
him of being slow. He was as picturesque as he
was handsome, with a slow, rare smile that women
loved.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span></p>

<p>He extended a large, white hand with artistic,
tapering fingers, which closed over Jessica's with
a warmth of pressure that was infinitely strength-giving,
his eyes lighting with a pleasure he did
not hesitate to express.</p>

<p>"Halloo, Leith, old man!" cried Jessica, not
loudly, not coarsely, but with a fascinating slanginess
of manner that no one under heaven could
ever imitate. "Thought you were in the jungles
killing tigers. When did you get back, and did
you bring me that skin you promised? 'Pon my
soul, I'm glad to see you! Heard the news?"</p>

<p>"You always take my breath away, Jessica," he
answered, with the irresistible smile spreading over
his face. "How do you do, Mrs. Chalmers. What
have you been doing to yourself? Time has been
going backward, the old traitor. I never saw you
looking so well. It isn't fair in the very least,
robbing young girls of their rightful prey. Is
there any news, Jessica? I haven't heard any in
so long that I can scarcely believe it possible."</p>

<p>It was a long speech for him. He did not usually
trouble himself to such an extent, and when he
had finished he threw himself into a chair as if
exhausted.</p>

<p>"News&mdash;well, I should say so!" exclaimed Jessica,
her brown eyes aglow. "When did you get
back?"</p>

<p>"Yesterday."</p>

<p>"Then you haven't heard. We arrived this
morning."</p>

<p>"Really? From where?"</p>

<p>"Louisiana. We've been having an addition to
the family; but it's a grown-up one. Mamma has
another daughter."</p>

<p>"You don't mean it?"</p>

<p>"Yes, truly. What do you think of it?"</p>

<p>"How can I tell until I have seen her? You
didn't take me for a clairvoyant, did you? But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
really, for selfish reasons, I'm awfully sorry. It
will spoil the number and break up all our sport."</p>

<p>"Not much!" exclaimed Jessica, with conviction.
"Rather than that I should send her back to the
savages that she came from. Did you bring Olney
Winthrop back with you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, poor old chap. He had rather a narrow
shave with a panther, and then was almost carried
off with jungle fever. He will certainly not remind
you of the flesh-pots of Egypt when you see
him. He is all broken up, and insists that there
is nothing that will restore him like a little game.
I have come to ask if you will have us this evening?"</p>

<p>"Well, rather!" exclaimed Jessica.</p>

<p>"My dear," said Mrs. Chalmers, dubiously, "do
you think you had better&mdash;so soon?"</p>

<p>"Rats!" cried her daughter, inelegantly, but
without the slightest indication of vulgarity. "Do
you think I am going to be shut off from the
world because Carlita has come here? Come off!
Come by all means, Leith, and bring Olney Winthrop.
We'll see if we can't bring a little life back
to his veins. And you might ask Redfield Ash,
if you should happen to run across him. Four is
not a good number for poker, and Redfield Ash is
the most unlucky man alive. By the way, would
you like to see our savage?"</p>

<p>"I am always interested in anything or any one
that concerns you."</p>

<p>Her eyes lighted pleasantly as she touched a
bell and said to Marie:</p>

<p>"Ask Miss de Barryos to come here, Marie."</p>

<p>"What a very swell name. Is she a Mexican?"
inquired Pierrepont.</p>

<p>"Her father was. Her mother was an old school
friend of mamma's, and I do believe mamma is
afraid of this half-breed."</p>

<p>"Nonsense, Jessica."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span></p>

<p>"It is true, just the same. You never saw such
a change in your life since the savage came among
us. I really think she expects to see the scalping-knife
in the girl's hand every time she comes&mdash;Oh,
Carlita! I sent for you to introduce one of
our dearest friends, Mr. Pierrepont. Miss de
Barryos, Mr. Pierrepont."</p>

<p>Leith Pierrepont arose and looked into the girlish
face. He knew from the fire in the dark eyes
and the crimson glow in the olive cheeks that she
had heard every word that had been spoken concerning
her, and there was an expression of sympathy
in his eyes as he put out his hand.</p>

<p>Carlita did not take it. She stood there for a
moment haughtily erect, dumb with indignation,
her fierce anger rising in bitter words to her lips;
but she repressed all sound, forbade herself the
utterance of the torrent of hot, wrathful words that
arose to her lips, and bowed coldly.</p>

<p>Pierrepont withdrew his hand and placed it carelessly
upon the back of his chair, as if he had not
observed the cut, and said quietly:</p>

<p>"It is a great pleasure to me to meet you, Miss
de Barryos. Miss Chalmers tells me that your
father was a Mexican. I knew Juan de Barryos.
I met him in the City of Mexico a number of years
ago. He was the nephew of the Count of Regla,
one of the old Spanish grandees, and one of the
most picturesque characters in Mexican history.
Juan de Barryos was an owner of mines of enormous
extent, as was his uncle, the more world-famous
Count of Regla. Juan de Barryos was a
relative of your father?"</p>

<p>He asked the question curiously, half interrogation,
half exclamation, and she answered proudly:</p>

<p>"Juan de Barryos was my father's brother and
my guardian until the time of his death."</p>

<p>"Really! Then by my friendship for your uncle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
I ought to be allowed to claim some sort of acquaintanceship
with you, ought I not?"</p>

<p>"I never saw my uncle but twice," she returned,
coldly. "His friends were not mine."</p>

<p>Jessica crimsoned, half with anger, half amusement.
She was not anxious that Carlita should
make a good impression upon this man, but her
reply was almost rude. Still Pierrepont was unruffled.
He turned indifferently to Jessica:</p>

<p>"I am afraid I have overstayed my time," he
exclaimed. "May I call it an engagement and
bring poor Winthrop tonight?"</p>

<p>"Decidedly."</p>

<p>"Then good-afternoon. Miss de Barryos, I am
very glad to meet Juan de Barryos' niece, in spite
of the fact that she knew him almost as little as a
stranger might. It was a great misfortune to you,
for he was a charming man. Good-afternoon, Mrs.
Chalmers."</p>

<p>He shook hands with his hostess and was gone.
But almost before he had disappeared, Carlita had
slipped away to her own room.</p>

<p>She stood there in the center of the room with
her hands pressed passionately upon her breast,
allowing her fierce anger full play upon her features.</p>

<p>"They hate me!" she cried, fiercely. "Hate me,
because of that cursed blood of the Indian that
flows within my veins. They hate me! Oh, God,
if I could but open them and let it out drop by
drop. If I could but be like others are. They hate
me and I have allowed them to see their power to
hurt me; but it shall not be so again. I will show
them that I am not the thing for which they have
taken me. I will show this woman and her daughter
that I am not the weak, characterless thing
that they have thought. They shall regret their
words. I swear that&mdash;I swear it!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span></p>

<p>And in the meantime Leith Pierrepont walked
indolently down the street, musing dreamily.</p>

<p>"What a deuced pretty thing she is," he said to
himself. "What eyes! What a complexion! I
don't believe I ever saw a woman in my life who
looked like her. My dear Jessica, I am afraid you
have made a mistake in allowing this addition to
be made to your family. She is the very most
beautiful, wonderfully picturesque girl that an
artist could fancy. If she doesn't make a sensation,
then I'm mistaken. Heigh-ho! Leith, old
fellow, if she plays such havoc with every man's
heart as she has with yours in this short time, I
shall be sorry for the other women. What a confounded
shame it is that she has fallen in with
the Chalmers. I wonder how it happened? I believe
for the first time in my life I am curious.
Carlita de Barryos! She's of a rattling good family,
if there is a trace of Indian in her&mdash;which I
don't believe altogether, and she's the most graceful
person I ever met, and the highest-tempered
to have absolute self-control. God! wasn't she
furious! Cursed little vixen is Jessica, but fascinating.
Carlita de Barryos! Upon my soul, old
fellow, I believe you've seen the first woman you
ever saw in your life that you'd like to make your
wife! Funny, too, that I should meet her there&mdash;there
of all places. The longer a fellow lives the
more waggish the world grows for him."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV.</a></h2>


<p>To the surprise of both Mrs. Chalmers and Jessica,
Carlita came into the room before the arrival
of their expected guests that same evening.</p>

<p>She was gowned in black, but it was black chiffon;
the silk lining of the waist cut low, her beautiful
throat gleaming like marble under its soft
covering. Her hair was parted, and fell in great
waves down to her ear, from which it was drawn
back to the nape of the neck, a few small curls
drooping upon the olive brow. The daintiest of
bloom stained her cheeks and lips, and there was
an added light in the dusky eyes that made her
almost thrilling in her strange beauty.</p>

<p>For the first time Jessica looked upon her with
a little start and slight contraction of the brows.
She had said quite truly that she had never been
jealous of the beauty of any woman, and yet she
was conscious of a distinctly unpleasant sensation
as her mother's ward stood before her. She had
said that Carlita lacked style, and yet in that moment
she realized that there was something better
than mere style in the young girl's make-up; there
was an individuality, a charm, a wonderful grace,
as if some exquisite conceit of one of the old
masters had suddenly stepped from its frame and
stood there in flesh and blood reality.</p>

<p>Jessica bit her lip. For the first time in her
recollection she found herself disconcerted. She
could find nothing to say. She wanted to invent
some excuse to banish Carlita from the drawing-room,
but could make none. And before she could
recover her accustomed aplomb, the little maid
Marie announced Mr. Pierrepont and Mr. Winthrop.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span></p>

<p>Carlita stepped aside and looked from one to
the other of the two men.</p>

<p>She observed the magnificent proportions of the
one whom she had met in the afternoon, enhanced
by a dress-suit which fitted him singularly well,
noted the slow grace of his perfect manner, and
then turned to the other one.</p>

<p>He was tall also, and slight almost to emaciation.
His eyes were of Saxon blue&mdash;honest eyes
that were like those of a frank, generous boy who
loves life, loves the world, loves happiness, loves
danger even, but has never learned to dissemble.</p>

<p>He showed traces, even the presence, of a terrible
illness; but there was something that caught
and held her interest and her sympathy in the
smile that he bent upon Carlita when Mrs. Chalmers
had performed the introduction.</p>

<p>"It is so delightful to meet you, Miss de Barryos,"
he said, genially. "Leith told me that he
had forestalled me this afternoon, and also that
you were something of a Mexican. I should have
known it even if he hadn't said so, and the inclination
to call you senorita was almost uncontrollable.
I have been in Mexico frequently, and&mdash;oh,
love it!"</p>

<p>"I don't know it at all," Carlita answered. "My
mother was an invalid for years, and we never
traveled."</p>

<p>"Ah, you have so much in store," enthusiastically
returned the musical voice of the young man.
"And there is no place under all God's sun where
the grass is so green, where the sunlight is so
brilliant, where the flowers are so gorgeous, and
where the birds sing as they do in Mexico. The
brilliant, thrilling coloring is so magnificent that it
seems to fill one's veins to bursting with the very
delight of living. How you will love Mexico! You
speak Spanish, of course?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span></p>

<p>"My father taught me when I was a little
child."</p>

<p>"And you have not forgotten?" he questioned,
speaking the words to her in Spanish as he smiled
at her delightedly.</p>

<p>"I have not forgotten," she answered in the
same tongue, the words flowing in liquid beauty
as English words never could flow.</p>

<p>"It is such a pleasure to be able to speak the
language sometimes," he continued, still in Spanish.
"And&mdash;will you pardon me if I say you speak
it exquisitely? Leith knows almost every other
language under the sun except Spanish, and it is
really the only one I care a copper for. Will you
let me come sometimes and talk to you&mdash;some
afternoon when there will be no one else? You
know I am an invalid now, and am doing nothing
but recuperate. I came near going off the other
day with jungle fever. It's a nasty thing, and
leaves a fellow so infernally weak. It would be a
positive charity if you will let me come sometimes."</p>

<p>"I should be glad to have you," she answered,
earnestly.</p>

<p>And then some one else was announced whose
name she did not quite catch&mdash;another man&mdash;and
then she saw that Leith Pierrepont had taken his
friend's place.</p>

<p>She was conscious of a distinct shock that was
almost anger. Her cheeks grew hot. She was
angry with herself, and lifted her eyes to his face
half in defiance, though of what she could not have
told.</p>

<p>He was smiling down upon her with that rare
smile that somehow she knew already, though she
had only seen him a moment that afternoon.</p>

<p>"Even if you do speak Spanish with Winthrop,
you won't let him quite monopolize you, will you?"
he said to her in that dangerously low, caressing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
tone he knew so well how to use. "I am afraid I
didn't make a good impression upon you this afternoon.
I was unfortunate enough to introduce
some subject that did not meet with your approval
altogether, and&mdash;you don't like me. Is that true?"</p>

<p>She flushed again angrily, seeing the smile lurking
behind his magnificent eyes.</p>

<p>"I never presume to form opinions of strangers,"
she answered, haughtily; and then could have bitten
her tongue for making so childish a reply.</p>

<p>She saw, however, at once that it had not ruffled
him in the least, for he replied, lightly:</p>

<p>"I am so glad you are not impulsive. Young
ladies usually are. If you had been, I should despair
of ever winning your good-will; but as you
assure me it is not so, why, I shall hope to be one
of your first friends in your new home. Have you
known Mrs. and Miss Chalmers long? Are they
related to you?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no! Mrs. Chalmers and my mother were
school friends. They have not met since then;
but the old warm attachment was always maintained,"
she replied, thankful to him for showing
her a way to change the subject.</p>

<p>He looked over her head curiously, an expression
of relief, she almost thought, coming into
his eyes.</p>

<p>"Oh," he returned, "I see."</p>

<p>"See what?" she asked.</p>

<p>He looked down quickly and straight into her
eyes.</p>

<p>"Nothing," he said, slowly. "I only see as
blind men do. Do you play poker?"</p>

<p>"No. I have never seen it played; but I dare
say I shall learn quickly enough."</p>

<p>He leaned toward her, resting his elbow upon a
convenient mantel-shelf. His eyes were bent upon
her, dark with meaning.</p>

<p>"Don't!" he said earnestly. "If you were an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
impulsive young lady who had formed a swift
friendship with me, I should entreat of you, by
that friendship, not to do it. It is a game which
it would break my heart to see&mdash;my sister play."</p>

<p>The words had barely been spoken, when Jessica
touched him upon the arm with her fan. There
was an expression upon her face which no one had
ever seen there before. Her voice was light, and
did not match it in the least, as she exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Come! the table is waiting. Carlita, a novice
at poker always wins. Shall we lose all our money
to you tonight? Will you take a hand?"</p>

<p>The words were meaningless to Carlita, but she
hesitated. She wanted to do that which would be
in defiance of Pierrepont's wishes. She glanced
from Jessica to him; then, moved by an influence
which she could not combat, she answered:</p>

<p>"I will not play, thank you, Jessica."</p>

<p>Miss Chalmers bit her lip. With her fingers
upon Pierrepont's arm, she led him away, while
Winthrop again took his place.</p>

<p>Mrs. Chalmers had seen the entire by-play, and
a look of anxiety crossed her brow.</p>

<p>"Great heavens!" she muttered, "Leith Pierrepont
has fallen in love with that girl, as sure as
fate! Well, God help her when Jessica finds it out
beyond a doubt!"</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V.</a></h2>


<p>Redfield Ash came as they were about to sit
down to the table, making six for the game with
Henry Fielding, who had arrived just before, and
with an eagerness which he rarely showed, Olney
Winthrop turned to his hostess.</p>

<p>"Will you excuse me, dear Mrs. Chalmers, if I
beg off?" he exclaimed. "Five is a much better
number than six. Miss de Barryos and I will
utilize the time in rubbing up our Spanish together.
It is such a pleasure to meet some one who
speaks it."</p>

<p>Jessica glanced swiftly toward Pierrepont, and
noted all too clearly the shadow of annoyance that
crossed his brow. She even heard it in the tone
of his voice as he exclaimed rather suddenly for
him:</p>

<p>"I thought this game was made especially for
your benefit?"</p>

<p>At another time Jessica would not have allowed
his withdrawal, but now she cried with a sweetness
of accent that attracted the attention of her
mother:</p>

<p>"By all means talk to Carlita, Mr. Winthrop. It
is really very kind of you. The next time you
come I shall take special pains that she joins our
game."</p>

<p>She did not look at Pierrepont, but he glanced
toward her coolly, insouciantly, muttering mentally:</p>

<p>"The little fiend heard what I said. She is determined
to ruin that girl, but I swear she shall
not! Let us see who is stronger, my dear Jessica,
you or I!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span></p>

<p>But there was no man at the table apparently
less interested than he. He shuffled with a dexterity
that baffled most men, talking lightly of his
stay in India and of Winthrop's narrow escape from
the panther, to all appearances oblivious of the fact
that Winthrop and Carlita had wandered from the
room, she with her great dark eyes turned interestedly
upon Winthrop, in earnest conversation with
the language unintelligible to him.</p>

<p>"You are a stranger in New York, are you
not?" Winthrop asked, as he threw himself into
a chair beside her in the library, leaning toward
her, a faint flush lifting the pallor of illness.</p>

<p>"Yes. We arrived this morning, and I have
never been here before."</p>

<p>"Ah, there will be so much to see. The opera
begins next week, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I am in mourning."</p>

<p>The voice was very soft, almost tremulous, and
Winthrop started.</p>

<p>"I beg ten thousand pardons!" he exclaimed,
gently. "And it is your mother, too. It always
seems to me the saddest thing under heaven when
a girl like you loses her mother. Mrs. Chalmers is
your guardian, is she not?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Of course I ought not to ask it, I who am a
perfect stranger to you, but somehow it does not
seem to me that I am a stranger. There is some
sort of immediately established friendship that
makes me feel an interest that perhaps is not
reciprocated, and you might resent it as an impertinence."</p>

<p>There was something so frank and honest in the
clear blue eyes that Carlita felt herself insensibly
warmed by the man's manner, and answered cordially:</p>

<p>"I assure you I would not. I have not so many
friends that I can afford to decline an honestly offered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
friendship, such as I am sure yours is. I
am very grateful."</p>

<p>The words were simple enough, but there was
something in her manner that touched the young
man deeply, and leaning forward, he lifted her
hand and pressed it ever so lightly to his lips.</p>

<p>"Thank you," he said, softly. "I shall appreciate
the trust above everything else in this world.
Then I may ask if&mdash;if you&mdash;are quite&mdash;quite happy
here?"</p>

<p>She looked a little surprised for a moment, then
the expression of the blue eyes reassured her. She
knew she could trust him, knew that he meant her
no harm. There was a curious feeling of perfect
safety, of implicit confidence in him that she had
never felt toward any human being in her life before.
It affected her strangely, and there was just
a shadow of unshed tears in her eyes as she replied:</p>

<p>"I ought not to say that I am not happy, because
I know Jessica and her mother so little. I
have been brought up in such a narrow circle. My
knowledge of the world is so limited. Papa died
when I was a small girl, and mamma was an invalid,
as I told you. There were only the neighbors,
good people, but not much up in matters of
the world, so that it is all new and strange to me. I
don't want to show that I am ignorant; I want to
do that which Jessica and Mrs. Chalmers tell me;
I don't want to appear a little Puritan idiot; but
there are some things that do not seem exactly
right to me, and I have not learned yet to reconcile
myself to them. You see how I have trusted
you."</p>

<p>She smiled a trifle wistfully, and he leaned a little
further toward her, as if protectingly, as he
replied:</p>

<p>"And I shall try all my life long to show you
how I appreciate the trust. I understand so well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
how you feel. I would not alarm you for all the
world about your position here, but&mdash;but there
are some things that I&mdash;I would not have you
learn. One of them is to play poker."</p>

<p>"And yet you came here to play with me?"</p>

<p>"I have never seen you. I did not know you. I
would not sit down at a poker-table with you now
for&mdash;for my right arm."</p>

<p>He said it so earnestly, so sincerely that she
started.</p>

<p>"Is it so wrong, then?" she asked, quickly. "Is
it so great a sin?"</p>

<p>He appeared embarrassed.</p>

<p>"I hardly know how to answer you," he returned
gently. "It is a sin in a sense. It is gambling,
and all gambling is sinful. I would not have you
understand me that Jessica or Mrs. Chalmers is
doing anything criminal, but&mdash;I should so much
prefer that you would not join them."</p>

<p>"And yet you do it?"</p>

<p>He flushed crimson.</p>

<p>"My dear child, my little friend, you will learn
that men are permitted acts which the world does
not allow to women. I am not going to argue with
you about the right or wrong of it. There is a law
which is as binding as the Christian oath, and that
is the law of custom. The world has a code of its
own, and right or wrong, we must follow it. I will
promise you one thing, however, that is, that if
you will never play a game of poker, a game of
anything that involves money, I never will either.
Will you do it?"</p>

<p>It never occurred to either of them that it was
an extraordinary thing for them to do upon the
occasion of their first meeting. It is doubtful if
they remembered that it was their first meeting.</p>

<p>He extended his palm, and she placed hers in it
with the confidence of a little child.</p>

<p>"I promise!" she answered, earnestly. "It is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
not the slightest sacrifice to me, but it will be a
great one to you if you have learned to like the
game."</p>

<p>"Not if my giving it up will benefit you in the
future," he answered, softly. "I wish that you
would remember our compact of friendship tonight,
and that if you ever need any one you will
send for me."</p>

<p>"I am not liable to forget."</p>

<p>"And there will be so many evenings next week,
next month even, when Mrs. Chalmers and her
daughter will be at the opera and you here of
necessity, perhaps alone. Will you let me come
sometimes and keep you company?"</p>

<p>"But you will be missing the opera yourself."</p>

<p>"That will be so little by comparison with gaining
an evening with you. May I come?"</p>

<p>"The promise means more to me than to you,"
she answered shyly. "I am not overfond of my
own society, but I am afraid you will not be recompensed."</p>

<p>He smiled enigmatically.</p>

<p>"We will read together, if you will. I used to
be called a good reader, and I'm sure you are,
from your voice. Do you sing?"</p>

<p>"A little. I have had no cultivation except what
my mother gave me, and that was not much."</p>

<p>"I'm sure your voice must be exquisite. It is
contralto, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"That is charming. I am passionately fond of
a good contralto. What delightful evenings we
shall have! I wish it were next week now. What
with our Spanish, our reading, and our music it
will be simply charming, quite as if we belonged
together and were at home."</p>

<p>He looked at her curiously as he made the
speech, and while she colored slightly, she offered
no objection.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span></p>

<p>"Are you fond of horses?" he continued.</p>

<p>"Very."</p>

<p>"Then perhaps you will let me come to take
you to drive."</p>

<p>"If Mrs. Chalmers does not object."</p>

<p>"May I ask her?"</p>

<p>"If you like."</p>

<p>"It is so good of you. I don't think I ever felt
so happy in all my life as I do tonight. I have
heard fellows speak of being drawn irresistibly to
one at a first meeting, but I could never quite understand
it before. I have been drawn to you by
an impulse that I have no more power to control
than I have over the action of the heart. I am
egotistical enough to think you are not quite indifferent
to me, as you have accepted my friendship
so generously. Isn't it true?"</p>

<p>"Quite true."</p>

<p>"I'm so grateful! I wonder if you know what it
means to a lonely fellow like me?"</p>

<p>"I ought. Am I not a lonely girl?"</p>

<p>"Yes; and it is so much harder for you than for
me. I have knocked about the country more or
less for the last ten years, not knowing one day
what I should do the next. I've got an object in
life now, and it seems very sweet."</p>

<p>"What is it?"</p>

<p>He colored swiftly and laughed shyly.</p>

<p>"I wouldn't dare tell you now, for fear you
might banish me; but some day, when I have persuaded
myself that I am more sure of attaining it,
I will tell you."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI.</a></h2>


<p>"Leith, what are you doing?"</p>

<p>Leith Pierrepont sat beside the window of the
bachelor apartment which he and Olney Winthrop
had taken together. It was a handsome apartment,
fitted up with one reception-room, in which
no one by chance was ever received, a library the
delight of a man's heart, two bedrooms, a dining-room
in which the breakfasts and dinners, if they
wanted them, were served by the caterer in the
house, and a bath-room, perhaps the most sumptuous
and pretentious room in the apartment.</p>

<p>It was in the library that they were now, Winthrop
stretched at full length upon a huge couch,
large enough for two to lie upon in comfort without
interference one with the other, a pile of pillows
under his head that might have satisfied a
woman, and a meerschaum in his mouth that was
as black as ebony and quite as well polished. His
hands were clasped under his head, and his eyes
were turned with great interest to his chum, who,
as has already been said, sat beside the window
with a cigar between his lips and a book in his
hand.</p>

<p>Occasionally the cigar was rolled from side to
side of the man's handsome mouth, the eyes were
thrown ceilingward, where they remained for a
moment or two, then returned with interest to the
book.</p>

<p>It was after half a dozen of these performances
that Olney Winthrop put his question, which had
to be repeated the second time before it attracted
the attention of the individual to whom it was
addressed.</p>

<p>"Leith, what are you doing?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span></p>

<p>"Studying."</p>

<p>The answer was given curtly enough, and for a
moment Olney was silent; but once again curiosity
mastered him.</p>

<p>"Studying what?" he ventured to inquire.</p>

<p>"Spanish."</p>

<p>Another silence, this time much longer than the
other. A change had come over Olney suddenly.
He took his hands out from under his head, and
looked toward the ceiling himself, as if he expected
some inspiration from that quarter. But evidently
it did not come. He drew on his beloved pipe for
some moments thoughtfully, then arose to a sitting
posture and leaned his arms upon his knees.</p>

<p>"What the dickens are you studying Spanish
for?" he demanded at last.</p>

<p>Leith Pierrepont turned his eyes in the direction
of his friend and looked at him absent-mindedly
for a moment, then said, calmly:</p>

<p>"H'm?"</p>

<p>"I asked what the deuce you are doing that
for?"</p>

<p>"Doing what?"</p>

<p>"Studying Spanish, of course."</p>

<p>"Why, to learn it, to be sure," returned Leith,
indolently. "What did I study French or German,
or any of the rest of it, for?"</p>

<p>"You did that in French and German countries,
and it was different. You are doing this here in
America, where no one speaks Spanish."</p>

<p>"It strikes me that you forget Miss de Barryos
very readily."</p>

<p>Leith knocked the ashes from his cigar as he
spoke, with the nonchalance of a person absolutely
indifferent to the subject upon which he is speaking;
but Olney happened to know him a little better
than to believe he felt as he appeared.</p>

<p>"She speaks English," he said, sententiously.</p>

<p>"I know, but she also speaks Spanish."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span></p>

<p>"And you are really learning it for that reason?"</p>

<p>"Certainly. What other?"</p>

<p>"Would you learn Chinese if Jessica were to
happen to speak it?"</p>

<p>"Certainly not. The interest is not the same by
any means."</p>

<p>Leith returned to his book, and Olney resumed
his position upon the couch. He did not look in
the direction of his friend, but steadily at the ceiling,
or in a line with it, for there was such a
cloud of smoke between that he could not see it.
He pulled at the pipe with a steadiness and
strength that argued well for the condition of his
lungs, then rose at last and laid it almost tenderly
upon a table.</p>

<p>He thrust his hands into the pockets of his
trousers and walked once or twice nervously up
and down the room; but Leith only kept on diligently
with his study, never glancing away from
his book, except toward the ceiling.</p>

<p>Olney could bear the silence no longer, and
broke it himself by and by.</p>

<p>"What do you mean by it, Leith?" he asked at
last, forcing himself to speak quietly, though he
was far from feeling it.</p>

<p>"Mean by what?" asked his preoccupied companion.</p>

<p>"Studying Spanish."</p>

<p>"My dear fellow," drawled Leith, "you really
appear to think there is something criminal in the
fact of my learning a language. What is there extraordinary
about it?"</p>

<p>"I never knew you to do it before for any girl."</p>

<p>"You never knew any girl before that I had
determined to make my wife."</p>

<p>Olney did not stare. A crimson glow crept from
throat to brow, but he did not cease in his walk
for some time. The desultory conversation stopped
again for a time; then he paused in his walk, at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
no great distance from Leith, and leaned his elbow
upon the mantel-shelf.</p>

<p>"Dear old boy, this is the first time in all our
histories that it has ever happened," he said,
somberly.</p>

<p>Once more Leith looked up from his lesson, this
time with a faint show of annoyance.</p>

<p>"Why will you persist in breaking out in that
fashion, as if you expected me to know in what
groove your mind has been wandering for the last
half hour?" he asked, irritably. "It is the first
time that what has ever happened?"</p>

<p>"That you and I have fallen in love with the
same woman!"</p>

<p>Leith looked at his friend for a moment, then
put his book upon the table, face downward, and
threw his cigar into the cuspidor.</p>

<p>"I was afraid of that," he said, slowly.</p>

<p>"Afraid of it!" echoed Olney. "You must have
known it."</p>

<p>"How should I? A fellow isn't always in love
with the girl to whom he pays attention."</p>

<p>"He is when the girl is one of the same kind
that Miss de Barryos is."</p>

<p>"Perhaps you are right. I'm awfully sorry, old
fellow."</p>

<p>"Sorry for what?"</p>

<p>"Sorry that you are in love with her."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Because she can't be wife to both of us, and I
mean to have her."</p>

<p>"Oh!"</p>

<p>"You see, Olney, you and I have been good
friends for ten years now, and ten years is a long
time, as years go. We've never had a disagreement
in our lives, except that you have perhaps had a
little more energy than was altogether comfortable,
and I'm as fond of you as I could possibly be of a
brother. You believe that, don't you?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span></p>

<p>"I know it; and it is that which hurts me."</p>

<p>"But you can't expect me to give up the woman
I love for you, can you?"</p>

<p>"Has she consented to be your wife?"</p>

<p>"No; I've never asked her."</p>

<p>"Then, you confounded, conceited cad, how can
you presume so upon her consent?"</p>

<p>There was no ill-temper in the remark. They
frequently used such tender epithets with each
other; and Pierrepont only smiled as he answered,
with perfect good nature:</p>

<p>"Did you ever know me to set my heart upon
anything that I did not accomplish?"</p>

<p>"No, confound you!" returned his friend. "But
I'll be hanged if you shall succeed with this!"</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"You can't expect me to give up the woman I
love for you," returned Olney, repeating his friend's
words with a sort of sneer; "now, can you? Well
I propose to marry Miss de Barryos myself."</p>

<p>"Has she consented?"</p>

<p>"I have not asked her."</p>

<p>Pierrepont laughed.</p>

<p>"Then, so far, apparently, we are on a perfectly
equal footing. All right, old fellow. It is rather
hard lines that we should have gone a-foul of each
other in this, of all things; but since it is so, let
us treat each other with perfect fairness. I tell you
frankly that I mean to marry Miss de Barryos."</p>

<p>"And my intention is equally strong that she
shall be my wife."</p>

<p>"So be it," returned Pierrepont with more earnestness
than he usually showed, though there was
still a smile clinging to his lips. "At least, one is
not deceived in the intentions of the other. I want
you to clearly understand me that I intend to
marry her. People have accused me of making
love to women every time I speak to one; but I
swear to you that I have never uttered to any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
woman the words that I shall speak to her, never
asked a woman in my life the question that I shall
put to her. I am thirty-four years old, Olney,
have never been balked in a desire in my life, and
I don't intend to begin with this which means so
much to me. It's a fair warning, old fellow."</p>

<p>Olney smiled.</p>

<p>"And forewarned is forearmed," he said, gravely.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII.</a></h2>


<p>"Oh, what a wretched ending! I positively hate
to read a book like that. It gives me the blues for
a week afterward. I don't see why writers can
not have some respect for the nerves of their readers
and not upset them with a jar that echoes
through every fiber of the body."</p>

<p>Carlita flung the book from her, crossed her
pretty feet, and leaning back in her chair, folded
her hands behind her head and looked at Olney
Winthrop, who was spending one of many evenings
with her while the others were at the opera.</p>

<p>He smiled rather gravely.</p>

<p>"I don't see how else it could have ended. She
couldn't have married the Disagreeable Man, you
know."</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"Oh, who would want to? A sickly, treacherous-tempered
beast like that."</p>

<p>"He wasn't anything of the kind. Do you think
a 'sickly treacherous-tempered beast' could ever
have written that exquisite letter which he tore
up? He was only fretted into irascibility by the
idiocy of others who had not sense enough to appreciate
him. No man could have been as fond of
his mother as he was and not be genuinely good.
I don't see why he could not have been happy as
well as any one else."</p>

<p>"He was treacherous-tempered or he wouldn't
have torn up the letter, you see," argued Olney,
mildly. "I don't see how she could have cared
anyway for a great, gaunt, sickly fellow like that."</p>

<p>"That is like you men. You never seem to think
a woman can like any one but a Hercules. For<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
my own part, I perfectly detest the conceited
creatures who think they are gods of creation, and
let you see it in every word they speak, in love
with themselves and unrivaled by any woman in
the universe, men like&mdash;like&mdash;well, Leith Pierrepont
for example."</p>

<p>Winthrop flushed eagerly, never observing the
curious break in her voice, then a sort of generous
remorse took possession of him that he had found
pleasure in that unjust criticism passed upon his
friend.</p>

<p>"Oh, really, you mustn't say that!" he stammered,
helplessly. "It isn't true of Leith, not the
least in the world. I don't know a fellow more
lacking in conceit than he. He is as generous
and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Pouf!" exclaimed Carlita, with the freedom of
a privileged friend. "Do you think you can make
me believe that? He thinks that every woman
who looks at him is ready to fall into his arms if
he would but say the word. There are times when
I positively detest him, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>Singularly enough, she did not complete her sentence.
She suddenly realized with a surprise that
was intense that there were tears in her eyes, hot,
angry tears, though why she should be angry, she
had not the remotest idea. She hated herself for
her absurd weakness, and sprang up swiftly and
went to the piano, and rattled off a waltz that came
more nearly being without time or melody than
anything she had ever attempted in her life before.</p>

<p>She excused herself to herself by mentally asserting
that the book, "Ships that Pass in the Night,"
had upset her, and then turned into a song that
trembled upon her lips with a sweetness and pathos
that her voice had never contained before.</p>

<p>It was only an old song, such an old one, with
the music entirely unworthy of the exquisite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
words, but she sang it with a depth of feeling that
made it sublime.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"How tired we feel, my heart and I,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">We seem of no use in the world;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Our fancies hang gray and uncurled<br /></span>
<span class="i1">About men's eyes indifferently;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Our voice, which thrilled you so, will let<br /></span>
<span class="i1">You sleep; our tears are only wet;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">What do we here, my heart and I?"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>But the last words were not spoken. They ended
in a little sob, a little sob that would not be
drowned by the power of the will. She would
have risen and escaped from the room, but that
Olney caught her about the waist, his face white
and wistful and filled with apprehension.</p>

<p>"Carlita," he exclaimed, his voice low and soft
with tenderness, "what is it? What has distressed
you? You trust me&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It is nothing," she cried, endeavoring gently to
free herself. "I am too stupid for anything. I
really believe I am hysterical over that absurd
book, and it is something new to me, too. You
mustn't mind me, Mr. Winthrop, for&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But I do," he interrupted, huskily. "Anything
that pains you is exquisite torture to me. I love
you Carlita, love you so that I can not conceal it
as the Disagreeable Man did. I must tell you.
It is so much better than that I should keep it to
myself until too late, if there should be any hope
for me. I am not conceited enough to think there
is&mdash;you mustn't believe that&mdash;but if love really
begets love, as they tell us it does, mine ought to
meet with some return, for Heaven knows it is
great enough. I feel as if I were the Disagreeable
Man myself, so gaunt and wasted through illness,
so unworthy of your sweet trust and affection, and
yet&mdash;Oh, Carlita, I don't want to wait as he did,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
when there might be hope. I know you don't love
me. I know I am the most presumptuous man alive,
that I can even speak upon the subject to you, but&mdash;but
won't you say something&mdash;something kind?"</p>

<p>She was standing and he sitting, holding her by
one hand, his other arm about her waist. He was
leaning toward her with his face lifted&mdash;a face so
true, so honest, so sincere, so wistfully pleading,
she almost imagined there was a moisture in the
frank blue eyes.</p>

<p>She didn't say anything. She was surprised, and
stood there staring down at him, her tears dried
suddenly. It seemed to her that she had never felt
so strangely in her life. He was the first man who
had ever whispered that magic word in her ear.
It moved her&mdash;moved her peculiarly. She felt the
strongest inclination to bend down and kiss him,
kiss him upon those blue eyes as she would a little
boy. He looked so pale and wan, so haggard
through the illness which he did not seem able to
shake off. Sympathy quivered in her heart like
the flutter of a dove's wings, but she could not
frame words to save her life, and stood there staring
down at him dumbly.</p>

<p>A great anguish arose in his eyes under her
silence. A cold dew gathered upon his brow and
stood upon his mouth. He dropped his arm from
about her waist and bowed his head.</p>

<p>"Forgive me," he said, hoarsely. "I ought to
have known, and not have distressed you with a
sentiment which I might have known you could
not reciprocate. I might have been satisfied with
your generosity in allowing me the privilege of
your society without presuming upon that generosity.
I suppose now I am to be banished, but I
deserve it for my presumption. All the sweet, long
evenings that have meant so much to me must be
at an end. I must go back to the old emptiness, the
old unrest."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>The word escaped her unawares, but she was
glad that she had spoken it when she saw him
fling up his head, saw the eager light that came to
his eyes, the flush that colored his pale cheeks.</p>

<p>"Carlita," he whispered, hoarsely, "that moment
was like&mdash;hell! Speak quickly! Can you be
my wife? Could you find in your pure heart toleration
for a fellow such as I? I will worship you to
the day I die! Speak and relieve me of this awful
suspense!"</p>

<p>"I have&mdash;have been very happy during these
evenings that we have spent together."</p>

<p>She never quite knew how she happened to say
that either, whether it was sympathy, whether it
was that she loved him, or&mdash;Oh, yes, she was
quite sure she loved him when she saw that wild
joy of expression. She did not shrink from him
in the very least when he arose suddenly to his
feet and drew her passionately to his breast. It
was really very comforting to think that she belonged
to some one, and that some one belonged
to her, and&mdash;loved her.</p>

<p>It was even pleasant to be passionately, lovingly
kissed, and as she looked with a smile into his
eager, craving eyes, she even lifted her mouth to
him of her own accord, and returned the caress
while she listened to the burning words that fell
from his lips.</p>

<p>"My darling, my wife, I can scarcely believe in
the reality of my own happiness. I can scarcely
believe it is true, that you love me, that you are
mine. It seems to me that I must be dreaming.
My God! if it be, let the dream last forever, forever!"</p>

<p>Jessica and Mrs. Chalmers returned before he
left her, but there was no announcement made to
them that night. They said good-night formally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
and separated, Carlita going to her room, and Olney
returned to his bachelor apartments.</p>

<p>He found Leith there before him, and went immediately
to his old friend and put out his hand.</p>

<p>"Congratulate me, old man," he said, with a
grin which was half idiotic in its happiness.</p>

<p>"Upon what?" inquired Leith, lazily.</p>

<p>"Miss de Barryos has promised to be my wife."</p>

<p>Leith did not even change color. He put out his
hand and took that of his friend cordially.</p>

<p>"Certainly I congratulate you, if you wish it,"
he said, with his accustomed nonchalant indolence.
"But what is the use? The marriage will never
take place."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"What I say."</p>

<p>Olney laughed lightly, disbelievingly, but there
was not the shadow of a smile upon Leith's perfectly
indifferent lips.</p>

<p>And Carlita had gone to her room, happy in the
happiness she had given, believing that she had
answered to the dictates of her heart, and then
slowly the expression of content faded from her
eyes, a white-lipped horror drew the corners of
her mouth. She looked into space dully, hopelessly,
stupidly.</p>

<p>She had suddenly remembered the curse of Pocahontas.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII.</a></h2>


<p>There was something of a sensation created in
the Chalmers household when the announcement of
Carlita's engagement was made.</p>

<p>Not that there was anything spoken in the presence
of Olney Winthrop but the sweetest words of
congratulation; but when he had departed, and
mother and daughter were left alone, the latter
stretched herself out at a comfortable angle, with a
cigarette between her lips, and exclaimed, leisurely:</p>

<p>"It appears, to a man up a tree, that we are getting
very little out of this game that we have
played. Do you propose to let Winthrop's pair
beat your full hand? It strikes me that you are
losing your cunning with a vengeance. Four weeks
in that beastly hole in New Orleans; a lot of sticky
black garments clinging about one for the same
length of time, and making life a nightmare; a
funeral to attend, and tears until one could float
a ship in them; acting a part from morning until
night, and even through the night, for what? The
really good Samaritan work of getting the little
mulatto engaged and robbing us of eight thousand
a year, not to speak of the advantage of handling
her money, and so affording an abode 'fitted to her
station in life,' as the idiotic lawyers say. Rats!
It isn't my line, I confess. What are you going
to do?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Chalmers pathetically fondled the ears of
her ever-present dog.</p>

<p>"How should I know?" she answered, meekly.
"I thought we were doing the safest thing possible
when we were keeping Leith Pierrepont away
from her. It never occurred to me that it could be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
possible that she would fall in love with Olney
Winthrop, though I knew he was head over ears
in love with her. I told you she was dangerous
when we brought her here, though you would not
have it."</p>

<p>"What were we to do with her, pray? A school
wasn't to be thought of at her age, and an asylum
wasn't possible, worse luck! But something must
be done. We can't commit highway robbery and
deliberately pilfer her estate. I confess it wouldn't
go greatly against my conscience, for I can see no
earthly reason why she should have all and I nothing.
But there is that confounded hole Sing Sing
to consider. Look here, the blood in your veins
has grown to milk and water recently. I wonder
if you would have the nerve to carry out an idea
that has struck me?"</p>

<p>"What is it?"</p>

<p>Jessica threw away her cigarette and lighted a
fresh one before replying. When she spoke again,
her voice had assumed a lower tone.</p>

<p>"You will agree, of course, that she is of a
wildly, sentimental nature, like all Mexican and
half-breed Indians. She has proven that by falling
in love with Olney's white face. I don't think
she cares the snap of her finger for him, except
that she pities him and&mdash;wants to be loved. It is
such a fine, beautiful thing. Pouf! Well, it is my
belief that if we could get him out of the way for
awhile, she would discover that fact, and jilt him."</p>

<p>"But how are we to get him out of the way?" inquired
Mrs. Chalmers, actually putting the dog
aside once and lifting her suspiciously golden
head interestedly.</p>

<p>"I haven't quite prepared that side of my subject,"
answered Jessica, calmly. "There has not
been time to go into it in detail as yet. The announcement
is too new, and I confess it never occurred
to me that she could be such a fool. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
am inclined to believe she might have made a sensation
if only she had been content to wait until
she got rid of that hideous mourning. Still, I have
thought&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"Winthrop is largely interested in some Mexican
mines."</p>

<p>"Yes, I know, I heard Leith Pierrepont speaking
of it."</p>

<p>"He must be suddenly summoned there."</p>

<p>Mrs. Chalmers lifted her head and looked at her
daughter admiringly.</p>

<p>"What a head you have, Jessica, to be sure!
But how is it to be accomplished?"</p>

<p>"That is the detail which I haven't quite mastered.
Do you know where your old friend Meriaz
is located?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Chalmers colored. She hesitated a moment,
then answered, slowly:</p>

<p>"Yes, I think so."</p>

<p>"That is good. Then we must utilize him. If
he had had a little more money, I should have
urged your marrying him. As it is, he must think
you mean to recall him, and so be made to serve
you."</p>

<p>"You forget&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, I don't forget anything. I am peculiarly
alive to the fact to which you would have called
my attention. We must insure the co-operation of
Meriaz."</p>

<p>"There will be no doubt of that. He will obey
my instructions."</p>

<p>"Are you sure?"</p>

<p>"Perfectly."</p>

<p>"All right. You write to him at once, telling
him where these mines are and all the information
which you remember Leith to have given. He can
arrange the details of the affair better than I can.
If you wish, you might tell him that I have fallen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
in love with the fellow, and that you are anxious to
get him out of the city on that account. Tell him
that Winthrop must be summoned at once, that
time is valuable, and that he must make the excuse
for summoning him there a tremendously
strong one, else it will be of no avail. You understand
just what I mean now?"</p>

<p>"Yes; and it strikes me as being a good one. It
will give us a chance to get abroad, if we see
that there is no possibility of weaning her from the
attachment."</p>

<p>"Yes, and in the meantime give me an opportunity
to look into her finances, and see what is
possible to be done. I haven't been down in
that God-forsaken country to be plucked of our
game by Olney Winthrop, I will tell you. Money
doesn't grow on trees, and it rather strikes me that
men are getting rather shy of our poker-table.
They don't seem half as anxious to lose their precious
ducats as they once did."</p>

<p>"Last night at the opera I heard a man in the
next box ask Dudley Maltby who you were and his
answer was: 'The most inveterate little gambler in
New York, and the most unscrupulous.'"</p>

<p>"Dudley Maltby said that?"</p>

<p>"He did."</p>

<p>There was a dangerous expression in the brown
eyes. For a moment the lips were slightly compressed,
then she arose and went to her desk quite
calmly.</p>

<p>"What are you going to do?" inquired her
mother.</p>

<p>"Ask Dudley Maltby to dinner and to the opera
Friday night. He shall pay for that remark with
every particle of his reputation."</p>

<p>"It strikes me that you are rather&mdash;rather neglecting
Leith of late."</p>

<p>"Nonsense! That is something which I shall
never do; but he is safe enough. He is more in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
love with me than he ever was in his life before."</p>

<p>Mrs. Chalmers looked a trifle uncomfortable.
She hesitated a moment while Jessica was selecting
a pen, then said, forcing herself to speak quietly:</p>

<p>"What makes you think so?"</p>

<p>"He told me tonight that I had neglected him
cruelly, and that he felt piqued and hurt. He said
that there was no woman who had the power to
hurt him as I had."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;but he&mdash;he didn't tell you that he&mdash;he
loved you, did he? He didn't ask you to be his
wife?"</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>Jessica turned suddenly, her interest in the note
abated.</p>

<p>"Nothing special," answered her mother, carelessly,
"only&mdash;only that he&mdash;well, he doesn't seem
half so devoted to you as he did before he went
away."</p>

<p>"He called upon me almost within the hour of
his return."</p>

<p>"Yes, I know he did, but&mdash;but he hasn't followed
it up well, and&mdash;my dear Jessica, I found a Spanish
book in his overcoat pocket tonight."</p>

<p>It never occurred to Jessica to ask how she had
found it in his overcoat pocket, or what she was
doing looking through the pocket. She was accustomed
to that, and thought nothing of it. It was
the fact which interested her. Her brows drew
angrily.</p>

<p>"Do you mean to say that you think he is in
love with Carlita?" she asked, her voice tense and
strange.</p>

<p>"Perhaps not exactly in love with her," answered
her mother, uneasily, "but very much interested
in her."</p>

<p>"I would kill her first! I would kill them both!"</p>

<p>The words came through the set lips as if the
speaker were perfectly capable of carrying out her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
threat or any other dire calamity that should suggest
itself to her, and Mrs. Chalmers moved anxiously.</p>

<p>"Perhaps I shouldn't have said quite so much!"
she exclaimed, soothingly. "It may be only a desire
to&mdash;to understand, but&mdash;but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I shall watch! I shall see!" exclaimed Jessica,
leaving her desk and walking restlessly up and
down the floor. "Do not fear but that I should
know how to revenge myself upon him as well as
her. I have rather suspected him. He has been so
careful of all that he has said to me since his return,
so careful of who should see him in our box.
He is not too good to be there, but he doesn't
want to be seen. I heard him say to her upon the
night of their first meeting, that it would break his
heart to see his sister play a game of poker."</p>

<p>"He said that?"</p>

<p>"He did! But I will teach him that he is playing
with an edged tool this time. I shall prove to
him that I know how to take a revenge, and it
shall be a bitter one, if he dares to do this thing.
Write your letter to Meriaz. I am anxious to see
this to the end."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX.</a></h2>


<p>"Aïda" was in progress at the Metropolitan,
and Jessica never lost a night at the opera. It was
the first time in all her life that enough money had
found its way into her exchequer to purchase a
season's box, and she was making the very most of
it that lay in her power.</p>

<p>Very many persons present had observed that no
woman ever found her way into that box, and that
most of the men concealed themselves in the rear,
or even contented themselves with a visit to the
anteroom. But Jessica never troubled her head
about that. She didn't like women, didn't want
women, and their absence affected her not at all.</p>

<p>Carlita was at home, as usual, beautiful as a
dream in her soft chiffon gown, the exquisite dark
hair rippling from her forehead in great waves
that no hair-dresser's art could ever imitate.</p>

<p>She was standing before a huge soft-coal fire,
looking down into it, with a faint smile curving
the corners of her mouth, as she waited for Olney
Winthrop&mdash;a smile which deepened as she heard
the chime of the door-bell.</p>

<p>There was not the faintest perceptible start at
the sound, not an increase of color at the knowledge
of her lover's coming. She lifted her head
to welcome him, and started, quivering in every
nerve in her body, her face flushing crimson, as
she saw who it was that had pushed aside the
heavy portière and stood there in her fiancé's place.</p>

<p>It was Leith Pierrepont.</p>

<p>He came forward with the easy, nonchalant
grace that was peculiar to him, the indolent smile
upon his mouth, looking handsomer than he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
ever done in his life before, and a woman would
of necessity have been made of granite not to have
seen it.</p>

<p>He put out his hand as he joined Carlita beside
the fire, and because she could not refuse, she put
her fingers into it.</p>

<p>She noticed that his hand had closed over hers
firmly, in spite of the fact that she had only intended
that he should touch it; and while he did
not retain it, he was in no hurry whatever to loosen
his grasp of the cold palm.</p>

<p>"Jessica and Mrs. Chalmers are not here," she
stammered, angry with herself that she could not
keep her voice steady.</p>

<p>"I know it," he replied, indolently. "They are
at the opera. Jessica never misses 'Aïda.' It is
a favorite of mine, too, and Nordica is excellent
in it."</p>

<p>"And yet you are not there?"</p>

<p>"There are some things that I prefer even to a
well-rendered opera. Olney will not be here this
evening."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>She flashed her great eyes up at him, as if he had
given her a personal affront. He smiled enigmatically,
and she flushed with anger.</p>

<p>"He has a headache," Leith returned, leisurely.
"You know he isn't strong. That dose of jungle
fever about knocked him out."</p>

<p>"I'm sorry he isn't feeling well. I'm&mdash;"</p>

<p>She strove to infuse the sentence with earnestness,
but her voice had never sounded colder in her
own ears, and she found it impossible to finish the
speech. She paused uncomfortably, and after a
moment Leith said, with another smile that somehow
made her feel that she hated him more than
ever:</p>

<p>"Won't you ask me to sit down? I never could
stand with any degree of comfort."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span></p>

<p>"Certainly, if you wish to sit," she answered.
"I thought perhaps you would be going to the
opera."</p>

<p>"No; I told you I shouldn't," he answered, sitting
down gracefully and looking up at her carelessly.
"I had much rather hear you sing."</p>

<p>"But I never sing."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, you do. Olney has told me. He says
that you have a singularly lovely voice, and I have
always considered Olney one of the few really good
judges of music."</p>

<p>"I am not a musician."</p>

<p>"You mean you don't play your own accompaniments.
That makes no difference. I will be very
glad to do it for you. I am not in particularly good
practice, but I used to be called rather good at that
sort of thing."</p>

<p>She had seated herself, and as he spoke he rose
as if he were going to the piano; but, instead,
leaned over the back of the chair and looked down
upon her. The look seemed to get into her veins
and tingle through her blood like living fire. His
voice was low and musical as that of a thrush,
as he said, softly:</p>

<p>"Why will you, who are always so kind and gentle
to others, be cruel to me? What have I done to
win your dislike? How have I sinned that you
withdraw your friendship from me alone of all the
world?"</p>

<p>She bit her lip to keep the hot tears out of her
eyes. She could not understand her own emotion,
and hated him that he had caused it. She arose,
not even glancing toward him, and threw out her
hands deprecatingly:</p>

<p>"You are making too much of the fact that I do
not care to sing for strangers," she replied haughtily.
"If it will interest you, I will try, but I assure
you that I am the most inexperienced of amateurs.
What would you like me to sing?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span></p>

<p>He did not reply to her. He was leaning against
the piano, looking at her, not impertinently, but
curiously, as if he did not quite understand her.
She allowed her fingers to wander over the keys
idly for a moment, then played and sang an excerpt
from "Gioconda," not with her usual style and
expression at all, but still with a sweetness and
depth of voice and a breadth of expression that
was infinitely pleasing.</p>

<p>"You can't do a thing of that sort playing your
own accompaniment," he said, when she had
finished, not complimenting her at all upon her
beauty of voice or method. "Let me sit there, will
you?"</p>

<p>She arose at once, a trifle nettled at his lack of
praise, and he took the stool she had vacated. His
fingers touched the piano with a tenderness that
went to her soul. She loved music with a sort of
ravenous passion, if one may so express it, a wild
longing that had never been gratified, and she
listened with an increased fascination that held
her speechless.</p>

<p>"Do you know 'Aïda'?" he inquired at last.</p>

<p>She nodded.</p>

<p>"Do you remember the duet in the tomb?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>His fingers wandered into it, then his glorious
voice, sweet as the lower tones of a harp, rang out
full and rich. She joined him when her time came,
singing as she had never sung before, enthused by
the genius which she had never expected, enchanted
by the magic of his touch.</p>

<p>When it was finished he turned to her.</p>

<p>"Who taught you?" he asked, quietly.</p>

<p>"My mother."</p>

<p>"Your method is faulty. I wish you would go
to Arditi for a while. Your voice is excellent, but
you waste it deplorably. You have a warmth of
coloring and a breadth of expression rarely found,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
and would make a superb singer if properly taught.
Will you go to Arditi? Please do."</p>

<p>"Perhaps. I have never heard good singers,
that is, none except my mother, and she was not
great. You have studied, of course?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes; in Paris and Italy. Shall I sing something
for you?"</p>

<p>"If you will."</p>

<p>He looked up at her. There was just the glimmer
of a smile in his eyes, such a curious smile, so
wistful, almost beseeching, a pathetic smile that
made her heart tremble in spite of her hatred of
him, that extraordinary hatred which she had
never been able to explain to herself, and for which
she could have found not the shadow of a cause if
she had dared to question herself upon the subject.</p>

<p>His hands continued to wander over the keys as
if he were improvising, and after a little time his
voice, sweet, gentle, so low that it could scarcely
have been heard behind the portières that fell between
them and the hall, floated out:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"'The solemn sea of silence lies between us;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">I know thou livest and thou lovest me;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And yet I wish some white ship would come sailing<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"'The dead calm awes me with its awful stillness,<br /></span>

</div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span></p>
<p>He had never removed his eyes from her while
he was singing, but she had dropped hers. The
crimson glow which she could not command had
crept into her cheeks. His voice fell almost to a
whisper, and as the last word left his lips, he lifted
his hands from the keys and imprisoned both of
hers together, leaning toward her with his splendid
face uplifted.</p>

<p>"Do you know what that sea of silence is, Carlita?"
he asked, his low voice thrilling through her
like old wine. "It is that great gulf that lies between
you and me. Shall I tell you more?</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"'I am oppressed with this great sense of loving&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">So much I give, so much receive from thee;<br /></span>

<span class="i4">So floats the fragrance of thy love round me.'"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>She lifted her eyes, startled, wide with horror
and alarm, and would have drawn back but that he
held her, his beautiful eyes dull with passion.</p>

<p>"Did you think I did not know? Did you think
I should not comprehend?" he continued in the
same tone. "Did you really believe that I should
allow another to steal you from me? There have
been times when I almost thought you did not
realize that you love me. There have been times
when I have believed you fancied your heart given
to that other to whom you have promised yourself,
and then the knowledge of how absurd it all
was comforted me. The knowledge that some day
you would turn to me helped me to bear it all,
but the sea of silence is killing me, Carlita, drowning
me in my own desire. I love you&mdash;ah! you
know that, and the words are so weak. You know
that I would let the blood drain from my body
through the ends of my fingers, drop by drop, for
you. I don't believe you realized it all when you
promised to be another man's wife; but it could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
not be concealed from you always. Won't you
send the white ship across the sea, my darling?
Won't you speak some word to comfort my waiting?"</p>

<p>He had not spoken the words in the headlong,
pell-mell fashion of impassioned youth, but with a
feeling that held her spell-bound until the sound of
his voice had ceased, and then things looked black
and swam before her eyes as if she were suddenly
affected with vertigo. She staggered, and would
have fallen but that he arose, and, placing his
arm about her, held her closely. His warm breath
aroused her, and tearing herself from him, she
sprang aside.</p>

<p>"False friend! Craven! Coward!" she panted.
"How dare you? How dare you speak the words
to me that you have uttered? How dare you say
that I love you&mdash;you&mdash;you, the man who has
played the friend to Olney Winthrop, who has
pretended to love him as a brother does? You
come here in his absence, like the coward that you
are, to steal that which belongs to him&mdash;only to
him; but it is beyond you, thank God for that! I
hate you&mdash;hate you as I have never hated a human
thing in my life before&mdash;hate you for the cunning
coward that you are! I shall tell Olney Winthrop
of this, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>Pierrepont was leaning against the piano, all his
nonchalance, his graceful indifference returned,
listening to her as if she were speaking to him
only the pleasantries of the drawing-room. She
burst into tears before she could complete her sentence,
and he moved for a moment restlessly, but
naturally and calmly as he usually spoke, said:</p>

<p>"There will be no necessity for you to take that
trouble. I shall tell him myself before I sleep tonight."</p>

<p>"I hope that Heaven will spare me the insult of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
ever looking upon your face again!" she cried as
she started from the room.</p>

<p>She was forced to pass him in order to reach
the door, and as she would have done so, he
stepped before her almost indifferently. There was
the smile still upon his mouth, his eyes were brilliant
now, and his voice as slow and drawling as
ever.</p>

<p>"I just want to say a word before you go," he
said, quietly. "There will come a time when you
will wish to recall what you have said, when you
will yearn for the love which you disregard now.
When it comes, send for me. You need not fear
that I shall harbor any resentment for your cruelty.
When you send, I shall be ready to respond, even
if your message should reach me at the other end
of the earth. You are the only woman whom I
have ever loved, and some day you shall be my
wife!"</p>

<p>He said the words with gentleness and perfect
respect, but her face crimsoned with anger.</p>

<p>"Never!" she cried, fiercely.</p>

<p>He smiled.</p>

<p>"I have never failed to keep my word, particularly
when the promise was made to myself," he
answered, lightly. "Neither heaven nor earth, nor
life nor death, nor yet eternity itself, could stand
between us!"</p>

<p>He stepped out of her way, not a particle of excitement
visible in his manner&mdash;on the contrary, he
was calmer, more careless than usual&mdash;and she
looked into his face for one moment, then fled by
him and up the stairs to her own apartment.</p>

<p>Then she locked the door and threw herself
upon the bed, in a passion of tears&mdash;tears such as
she had never shed, not even at the death of her
mother; but they were so different&mdash;hot, angry
tears; and yet&mdash;yet there was some grief in them,
too, though she could not have told why.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span></p>

<p>It was almost daylight when Jessica and her
mother returned, and yet she was still lying there,
never having removed her clothing.</p>

<p>She got up then, in a shamed sort of way, and
undressed herself; but it was of the man she hated
that she dreamed, not the man she loved; it was
the gray eyes into which she looked, not the blue;
and she rose in the morning unrefreshed, and with
eyes still swollen from weeping.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X.</a></h2>


<p>Olney Winthrop was detained away for four
days on account of illness, but on the fifth he came
again.</p>

<p>He was pale and haggard, and about the mouth
there was a wistful expression that touched Carlita
in the old, fond way. She went up to him and
placed her hand upon his shoulder with a loving
gesture.</p>

<p>"You have been ill," she said; "but I did not
dream that it had been so bad. Why did you not
let me come to you?"</p>

<p>"You would have come?"</p>

<p>"Can you ask?"</p>

<p>She looked pathetically into his eyes and allowed
him to kiss her. It brought a flush to his pallid
cheeks and a warm light to his worn eyes.</p>

<p>"I wonder if man was ever blessed with so
sweet a love as I?" he asked, more of himself than
of her, his voice low with emotion. "Carlita, if I
should lose you, death, by any means whatever,
would be a happy release. You love me, darling?
Say it once again. It is not that I doubt, but only
that I adore the sound of the words from your
exquisite lips."</p>

<p>She shivered slightly, some of the bright color
fading from the olive cheek.</p>

<p>"What is it?" he questioned, with tender solicitude.</p>

<p>"I have so often meant to tell you," she answered,
her eyes not upon his, but fixed absently
upon a distant object which yet was unseen, "but
have not had the courage. It seems almost like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
stabbing a living thing to the heart to speak of it
to you; and yet&mdash;and yet&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Tell me, dear heart. Is there anything with
which you would not trust me?"</p>

<p>"It is only that I would not distress you. There
is an old curse in the family; such a foolish thing,
you will think, for nineteenth century people to believe
in, and I don't&mdash;really I don't; and yet it
makes my blood freeze in my veins sometimes
when I remember it. It is the curse of Pocahontas,
Olney. Have you heard what it is?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"It descends to the dark girl child of each generation&mdash;the
child that shows the trace of the Indian
in her unfortunate veins. It is a curse put
upon her love, that unhappiness, misery may follow
the giving of her heart, and&mdash;Olney, what a
fool I am to alarm you with this absurdity!"</p>

<p>He had started and grown a shade paler, then
caught her hands in a grip that would have hurt
her had she been more alive to physical emotions.</p>

<p>"Why do you listen to such things?" she continued,
laughing half hysterically.</p>

<p>"It was so strange," he returned, huskily&mdash;"so
strange that you should have mentioned it at this,
of all times."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Because I have received a summons which
takes me away from you for a time&mdash;upon a perilous
journey, perhaps."</p>

<p>"Where? Why?"</p>

<p>She was breathless, and returned the pressure of
his hands with a strength of which she was unaware.</p>

<p>"To Mexico. My whole fortune is involved, and
it is necessary that I should go."</p>

<p>She leaned toward him eagerly.</p>

<p>"Don't!" she whispered, hoarsely. "Something
tells me that you will not return. I have a presentiment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
of evil&mdash;a horrible presentiment! It is
the curse in reality. Don't go, Olney. My fortune
will be enough for both."</p>

<p>But he had recovered himself, and smiled reassuringly,
though feebly.</p>

<p>"We are foolish, my darling, both of us. I could
not be a dependent upon the bounty of my wife.
You must understand that, love. However much
one we may be, I could never consent to feel myself
a burden. Don't ask it of me, dearest. It
would only make the temporary parting all the
harder to bear, and you must have strength to
bolster up my weakness."</p>

<p>"Oh, Olney!"</p>

<p>"If you had never heard of that foolish curse,
you would think nothing of it; and if I had not
been ill and weak mentally as well as physically, it
would not have impressed me in the least. Remember
that you yourself called it an absurdity."</p>

<p>"But you are not well enough to go&mdash;not strong
enough to stand the test."</p>

<p>"The warmth of the climate will benefit me as
nothing else could. I shall not die, Carlita. The
thought of your love will give me every courage.
Besides, I shall have one near who cares for me as
a brother."</p>

<p>"You mean&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Leith."</p>

<p>She sat there for a moment, dumb, stunned,
never raising her eyes, but Olney was watching
her narrowly; then she drew a trifle closer to him,
and with bowed head, whispered:</p>

<p>"There is&mdash;something that&mdash;I must tell you. It
is about&mdash;about&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Leith?" he questioned, gently.</p>

<p>"Yes," she returned in a voice which he did not
remember.</p>

<p>"I know," he said, softly.</p>

<p>"He told you?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"And yet you&mdash;trust him?"</p>

<p>"As I would my brother," he returned, simply.</p>

<p>Her hand closed over his with a violence that
made him wince.</p>

<p>"God help you!" she returned, heavily. "I
loathe the man as I would a coiling reptile. There
can no good come of it. Remember that I have
told you this. God help you and help me, for the
curse has fallen, as I felt that it must when I
dared to love!"</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI.</a></h2>


<p>It was a very lonely time for Carlita, those weeks
that followed.</p>

<p>Of course she had Olney's letters, letters filled
with loving promises and words of hope for the
future; but letters are a poor substitute for the
presence of one we love. Still, they are infinitely
better than nothing. They came every day at first,
filled with all those messages so dear to a girlish
heart; then when he had gotten further down into
Mexico, where the mail service is so deplorably
bad, of course they became fewer. She had understood
that that must be so before he went.</p>

<p>He told her in many of them of the utterly uncivilized
state of the country, almost as uncivilized
as if millions of miles existed between it and our
own United States, of the long-cloaked, dark-browed,
sombrero-crowned men who either walked
or slunk through the streets when there were any,
or roads when there were not, of the strange, wild,
brilliant, many-hued country, that still had its inthralling
fascination for all its repulsiveness.</p>

<p>"I almost wish that I had persuaded you to come
with me, to give me your sweet companionship, for
I am sure that in spite of all the hardships, you
would enjoy it all," he wrote in one of his many
letters. "Even granting its barbaric state, there
is an unconscious poetry in it all that I am sure
would delight you, a tropical, luxurious, brilliant
beauty that gets into one's veins like wine, or the
seductive bewilderment of opium. I am not quite
sure but that you would never leave, but live on
and on, content, like these people, with only the
joy of living, the mere halcyon pleasure of existence&mdash;a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
lotus-eater. And yet there are parts of it
so wild, so superbly barbaric almost that the very
danger enchants one. I am growing well and
strong under the excitement of it all and the desire
to get back to you&mdash;the craving to feel the touch
of your dear lips, to feel the warmth of your beautiful
presence. Let us come here on our honeymoon,
will you? To the home of your own people.
Ah, there is romance enough in the very atmosphere,
in the gorgeous color, the song of the birds,
the picturesque buildings and customs and country,
to make one die from excess of loving."</p>

<p>But after that, as has been said, the letters became
less frequent, and there was nothing to do
but sit beside the window and watch for the postman&mdash;the
postman who went to others with his
messages of happiness or pain, as it might be, but
passed her by. She continued to write, though,
every day, just as if she had received her daily effusion.</p>

<p>But never once had Leith Pierrepont's name
been mentioned in it all.</p>

<p>It was very lonely. There were times when it
seemed almost as if Mrs. Chalmers and Jessica had
forgotten her very existence.</p>

<p>They rarely breakfasted before one o'clock in the
afternoon, and then Carlita had had her luncheon
and had gone out for a walk in the park or downtown
to amuse herself by looking in the shop windows&mdash;not
a very profitable pastime; but what was
the poor child to do? By the time she returned
they had gone for their drive, an excursion upon
which she was never asked, although it was her
money that paid for the new luxury of a victoria
and pair, not to speak of the sumptuous coachman
and footman; but she did not know it and therefore
thought nothing of the omission. Unless there
was a dinner party, which she never thought of
attending, Mrs. Chalmers and Jessica sometimes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
condescended to dine with her; but that was not
often; and if there was no opera in the evening
there might be a theater party, with a dinner afterward&mdash;a
really superb little dinner served by their
new French chef, which was practically the greatest
attraction the house offered since its reputation
for "extraordinary" poker had been established.</p>

<p>For every night, whether there had been an
opera or no opera, there was a poker game in
progress, and always enough people willing to
lose their money to make it profitable as well as
interesting.</p>

<p>A few women had joined their ranks, women
who rouged their faces and blackened their eyebrows
and wore peroxide of hydrogen hair strangely
like Mrs. Chalmers' own.</p>

<p>Carlita had seen the party once when the noise
was so great that she could not sleep. She crept
downstairs, concealed herself from sight, of
course, and watched them for a little while, but
her disgust was so great that she never did it
again, but often covered up her head with the bedclothes
in order to keep the sound out.</p>

<p>It was more lonely often than if she had lived all
alone, and so no wonder she thought of Leith
Pierrepont's words at last and of&mdash;Arditi.</p>

<p>She hated the very name of the man at first, because
Leith had asked her to study under him, and
then by degrees the thought became less repulsive
to her, and she finally concluded that in sheer self-defense
she would go and see him anyway, just to
satisfy herself as to whether she had any voice or
not, and to relieve the awful monotony of existence.</p>

<p>She found him&mdash;the great artist&mdash;in his studio,
and he listened kindly to her words and then tried
her voice. It was really a superb voice, filled with
color and feeling, and a breadth of tone that was
wonderful. He was delighted&mdash;as who would not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
have been?&mdash;and accepted her as his pupil gladly,
almost joyfully.</p>

<p>After that the work fascinated her, and she toiled
faithfully, making marvelous strides, assisted perhaps
by the very ache in her heart, for there is
nothing under heaven that develops the soul like
sorrow. I doubt whether a person has any very
great amount of soul cultivation until grief has
brought it there. And Carlita certainly suffered.</p>

<p>The letters had ceased altogether.</p>

<p>She was not particularly surprised at first, because
Olney had told her of the wretched condition
of the railroads, and consequently of the mail
service; but it couldn't have been quite so bad as
all that, to give her no letter in five long, apparently
endless weeks.</p>

<p>But she covered up the hurt in her devotion to
her new art, and Mrs. Chalmers and Jessica
watched her curiously.</p>

<p>"Who could wish for anything better than this?"
Jessica asked of her mother one day, as they heard
the strains of the piano from the room which, at
her request, had been set apart for her own particular
use.</p>

<p>"No one&mdash;if it could only last," returned Mrs.
Chalmers, with a little, only half-suppressed sigh.</p>

<p>But of course it couldn't, and that was the horrible
pity of it all.</p>

<p>The music lessons continued, and Arditi forgot
the time in his devotion to his new pupil.</p>

<p>"She is a genius!" he said, ecstatically; "the only
one that I have discovered in years. She sings
because she can't help it. She is like a bird in the
forest, except that there is a note of sadness which
the bird never acquires, because it has no soul.
Some day she will show the world what an artiste
is!"</p>

<p>And the full rich tones were floating out one day,
glorious as the minor strains of an organ, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
suddenly the tone failed, the hands fell upon the
key-board with a crash, the lovely face, flushed
with devotion to its new master, whitened, and a
little cry fell from the drawn lips.</p>

<p>She did not speak&mdash;it seemed as if she could not&mdash;and
after a moment of silence the man who had
caused her alarm went forward and put out his
hand.</p>

<p>She hesitated a moment, half drew back, then,
impelled by some strange power, placed her cold
palm in his.</p>

<p>"I am afraid I startled you," he said, in that
beautiful voice with which no male voice that she
had ever heard could remotely compare. "I asked
for Jessica and Mrs. Chalmers, but the servant said
they were in the park; then I heard you singing,
and begged to be allowed to come here. I see you
have taken lessons of Arditi, as I asked you. It
was very good of you."</p>

<p>"How&mdash;how do you know that I have?" she
stammered.</p>

<p>"Ah, who knows the method so well as I? There
is not another teacher in America that could do it,
and you have put your whole heart and soul into
it. God! what a voice it is!"</p>

<p>She threw out her hands deprecatingly.</p>

<p>"What matters it?" she cried, huskily, breathlessly.
"Tell me, when did you come? And where
is he&mdash;Olney? Why does he allow you to come
first?"</p>

<p>There was the bitterest pain in her voice&mdash;pain,
humiliation. Leith half put out his hand, then
withdrew it, as if he were not quite sure of what
it was that he would do. There was a new light in
his eyes&mdash;a curious light which she could not quite
comprehend. There seemed to be sorrow in it&mdash;sorrow
for her&mdash;and yet it glowed with passion
and&mdash;and something else&mdash;she could not quite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
make out what, but it frightened her. She drew
back and pressed her hands upon her breast.</p>

<p>"Is Olney with you?" she asked, whispering her
question in this new fear that had come upon her.</p>

<p>He shook his head.</p>

<p>"You have&mdash;left him there," she stammered,
helplessly&mdash;"left him in that awful place he wrote
me of&mdash;deserted him&mdash;when he needed you?"</p>

<p>The hollow tone of his voice as he replied was
not like that with which he had greeted her.</p>

<p>"There was nothing else to do," he answered,
simply.</p>

<p>She stared at him for a moment in a silence that
was uncanny, then said, hoarsely:</p>

<p>"What is it&mdash;you mean? He&mdash;he is not&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Dead?&mdash;yes," he said, completing the sentence
for her.</p>

<p>She stood there, just a moment, all the color
gone from her countenance, all the light from her
eyes, and then she fell forward; it would have been
at his feet but that he caught her in his arms.</p>

<p>He turned the white face upward and gazed into
it long, lingeringly, lovingly. There was a wistful,
yearning look about his mouth, a twitching at the
corners that spoke of a suffering to which he had
never given expression, and which was no longer
to be endured, and then&mdash;he couldn't help it, perhaps&mdash;he
bent his head and pressed his lips upon
hers.</p>

<p>She would never know; she was unconscious, he
told himself; but as he lifted his head with the
wild, passionate expression of self-loathing burning
in his eyes, he saw Jessica and her mother standing
in the door-way.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII.</a></h2>


<p>Perhaps of the three conscious ones, Jessica was
the first to recover herself.</p>

<p>A sort of fear that seemed to turn her cold from
feet to brow oppressed Mrs. Chalmers, and she
stood there white-lipped, stunned, in presence of
that unnamed terror, while her daughter went forward,
a smile that was almost playful making her
treacherous lips beautiful.</p>

<p>"Leith, really Leith!" she cried sweetly. "What
man but you ever could turn up in this most unexpected
fashion, or this most welcome one? Was it
your sudden coming that has upset Carlita? These
Southern women are so easily affected. Mamma,
can't you ring for Carlita's maid? Here is poor
Leith holding her in his arms as if she were a
china doll, which he feared to drop lest it should
break. Has she really fainted, or is it only one
of her pretty affectations because of the picturesque
comfort of the position?"</p>

<p>"I am afraid I was a little abrupt in breaking
some startling news to her," answered Leith,
quietly, thankful for once for the incessant flow of
Jessica's words. "Poor little girl! I am very sorry
for her."</p>

<p>"Really? What was it?"</p>

<p>"Wait a moment."</p>

<p>Carlita had stirred ever so slightly in his embrace
but he was painfully alive to every movement.
It seemed to him that it would be impossible
for him to look into her clear eyes then, eyes
lighted with hatred and loathing for his despicable
act, and it was with a feeling of absolute relief
that he resigned his precious burden to her maid,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
who, with the assistance of Mrs. Chalmers, took
her from the room.</p>

<p>"Do tell me!" cried Jessica, making not the
slightest pretense of interest in her mother's ward.
"I am consumed with curiosity. Is it about
Olney?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"He is ill?"</p>

<p>"Worse than that."</p>

<p>"Worse! Not&mdash;dead?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Good heavens!"</p>

<p>There was a desperate sort of silence that lasted
she could never quite remember how long, but her
mother's touch aroused her, her mother's voice
speaking in her ear in a low, strained tone, which
seemed unreal and ghastly to her.</p>

<p>"Olney is dead, Jessica. Do you hear me, child?
Olney Winthrop is dead."</p>

<p>The girl shook off the hand and lifted her white
face.</p>

<p>"Yes, I know," she answered, hoarsely, almost
gruffly. "What is the good of making a scene
about it? Many of&mdash;of our friends have died suddenly
who appeared less like it than he. What was
it, Leith&mdash;typhoid? Mexico is such a beastly hole
for typhoid."</p>

<p>Her mother heard and understood all the bravado
in the tone, and a shiver passed over her that
added to her pallor under all the ghastly, artificial
red. But she forgot it in listening to Leith's reply.</p>

<p>"No," he said, heavily, "it was not fever."</p>

<p>"Then what?"</p>

<p>He glanced away from her, even shot a half-nervous
glance in the direction of the door, which
was something he had never done before in his
life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span></p>

<p>"What was it?" she repeated, unable to control
her impatient excitement. "Not&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, murder!"</p>

<p>There was none of the old, graceful nonchalance
in the voice as he spoke that word. It was strained,
husky, tense, like that of a man who is putting the
most violent restraint upon some wild passion.</p>

<p>Mrs. Chalmers uttered a little cry, a cry that
could not be described in its terror, suspense, she
knew not what, of horrible presentiment; but Jessica's
head was flung up, her nostrils dilated, her
eyes wild and filled with a curious expression which
her mother could not fathom, even had she been in
a mental condition to try.</p>

<p>And then Jessica repeated that awful word, repeated
it in a voice which contained a note of triumph&mdash;hideous
triumph&mdash;that shot through her
mother's weaker soul with renewed terror:</p>

<p>"Murder!"</p>

<p>There were volumes in the mere utterance. She
stood looking at him for just a moment, then deliberately
sat down and crossed her hands between
her knees, looking up at him curiously. Mrs. Chalmers
leaned against the mantel-shelf for needed
support.</p>

<p>"How horrible!" exclaimed Jessica. "And that
it should be some one we all know&mdash;actually engaged
to Carlita! It reads quite like a story book,
doesn't it? Do sit down and tell us all about it."</p>

<p>But Leith did not sit. He passed his hands
across his brow as if his head ached.</p>

<p>"I can't," he answered, heavily. "It is getting
late, and I am worn out. I haven't slept for&mdash;I
can't remember just how long, but I feel seedy
and in need of rest. I think I'll go now, and come
again tomorrow, if you'll let me."</p>

<p>"But at least you'll tell us the main facts!" cried
Jessica. "It won't take a minute. Who murdered
him?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span></p>

<p>She seemed to delight in the mere utterance of
the grewsome word, and Leith shivered, though
his answer was filled with passion:</p>

<p>"I wish to God I knew!"</p>

<p>"Then you don't?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>The words were uttered so peculiarly that even
Jessica was silent for a moment, then said, with
sudden, swift meaning:</p>

<p>"Then you were not with him?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"And there was no inquiry made, no effort to
discover the murderer?"</p>

<p>Leith lifted his shoulders wearily.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," he answered. "But what does inquiry
amount to in a place like that? There is no
law, and a man's importance is measured by the
value of his hat and saddle, and the number of men
he has slain."</p>

<p>"Then you have no suspicion?"</p>

<p>"None." But he stooped to pick up a handkerchief
he had dropped as he spoke the word. "I
really must go now," he said when he had regained
it. "I am dead tired, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But you saw him after he was dead?" she persisted,
observing that his hand trembled, in spite
of his efforts to prevent it.</p>

<p>"Yes, I saw him," he stammered.</p>

<p>"Was he shot?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Where?"</p>

<p>"Directly through the heart."</p>

<p>"Ah! then he did not suffer much. You should
be glad he was killed at once, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>But it seemed to Pierrepont that he could bear
it no longer. His accustomed indifference had already
deserted him, and he felt that all his courage
was as rapidly following. He cried out passionately,
more passionately than she believed possible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
for him, even after the kiss she had seen him press
upon Carlita's lips:</p>

<p>"Glad! Glad, when it left not a moment for
preparation to meet that God whom he feared!
when it left not a moment for a word of farewell to
the girl whom he loved! Glad! Good God! I had
rather suffer a life-time of anguish than to die like
that&mdash;a rat in a trap!"</p>

<p>"And you buried him down there?" his pitiless
interlocutor continued.</p>

<p>"Yes," he answered, half sullenly. "What else
was there to do?"</p>

<p>"Why not bring him home to the girl he loved,
and who loved him?"</p>

<p>"Like that! It were a thousand times, ten thousand
times, better that she never saw him again.
Besides," managing by a superhuman effort to control
himself somewhat, "there was no way. It was
awful getting through, myself, and it would have
been impossible with him. There were miles and
miles that had to be done on mule-back, and miles
and miles more, even after we reached the railroad,
that had to be done on a hand-car. Then there
were land-slides that had to be walked over and
the car carried. Oh, it would have been impossible,
quite impossible, even if&mdash;if&mdash;"</p>

<p>"If what?"</p>

<p>"If I had desired to," he blurted out, hastily,
hoarsely. "I will come again tomorrow&mdash;tomorrow&mdash;when,
I hope, Miss de Barryos will be better.
Good-night."</p>

<p>He bolted from the room, snatched up his hat
and coat in the hall, and rushed into the street.</p>

<p>Already the lamps were lighted, flickering brilliantly
in the deadened gray of the gloaming that
was so rapidly fading into night. Pedestrians were
hurrying homeward, their faces cut to crimson by
the sharp, frosty air.</p>

<p>The sting of it was pleasant to Pierrepont. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
opened his mouth and drank it into his lungs with
the same relish that a thirsty man drinks water.</p>

<p>"God, what a relief!" he exclaimed, his step
growing more elastic. "She knew how she was
torturing me, saw it in every word that I spoke;
and I, fool that I was, was betrayed into weakness
and cowardice by a woman whom I despise! I felt
myself a criminal striving to avoid the accusation
of my crime. I think if she had cried out: 'You
are the guilty one! 'Twas your hand fired the shot
that killed poor Olney Winthrop!' I would have
sunk upon my knees and begged for mercy. Pouf!
how all this cursed affair has upset me! I wonder
if I shall ever be myself again? I wonder if I
shall ever be able to shake off the influence of all
these lies I have been forced to tell, and shall be
forced to tell from this time henceforth? God!
it's the old story retold of Adam and Eve, without
the Garden of Eden. A woman's beautiful face
makes cowards of us all. And I, who so despise
a liar, who never told a lie in my life until&mdash;"</p>

<p>He did not complete the sentence, but flung up
his head with a gesture of repugnance and abhorrence.</p>

<p>A slow, pitiless, scornful, malignant laugh fell
from Jessica's lips as she heard the outer door
close upon him. She got up, went to the window,
and watched him as he disappeared down the
street; then, quite as calmly as she had moved the
day before, returned to the mantel and laid one
hand upon it, while with the other she lifted her
dress and placed her foot upon the fender before
the fire. Then, after a pause:</p>

<p>"Why do you look at me in that uncanny sort of
way?" she exclaimed, half fretfully to her mother,
without even glancing in her direction. "You
make me feel creepy all up and down my back.
Why don't you say it out and have done with it?"</p>

<p>"Say&mdash;what out?" stammered Mrs. Chalmers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
her voice as stiff, as heavy, as full of terror as her
face.</p>

<p>"What you are thinking."</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I don't believe I&mdash;could. It seems to&mdash;me
that I&mdash;must have been asleep&mdash;and had a&mdash;horrible
nightmare. I&mdash;think I must have been&mdash;wondering&mdash;what
you&mdash;thought."</p>

<p>Jessica lifted her head. In the mirror she saw
leaning against the door-jamb a figure clothed all
in black, the white hands crossed upon its breast
as if to hush the wild throb of the passionate
heart. The beautiful face looked deathly in its
pallor. It was Carlita.</p>

<p>Jessica turned her eyes upon her mother as if
she had not seen, then answered slowly, her voice
vibrating with intense meaning:</p>

<p>"What I think of the murder of Olney Winthrop?
You mean whom do I believe to be the
murderer? I am quite sure there can not be two
ideas upon that score. The ball that entered Olney
Winthrop's heart was fired by the hand of Leith
Pierrepont, none other!"</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII.</a></h2>


<p>"The ball that entered Olney Winthrop's heart
was fired by the hand of Leith Pierrepont!"</p>

<p>Over and over again, like the insistent surge of
the waves, or the maddening repetition of some
wild, fantastic melody, those words kept repeating
themselves in Carlita's reeling brain.</p>

<p>She had crept away noiselessly when she had
heard them spoken, crept away and almost crawled
up the stairs to her own chamber, where the
gathering darkness lay in somber shadows. She
closed the door and turned the key, leaning against
it in a weak, half-relieved sort of way, like the
criminal who has gained a moment of respite from
his too close pursuers.</p>

<p>But the haunting memory of those ghastly words
aroused her again, and she pressed her hands upon
her breast, her great eyes peering into the gloomy
shadows, the words she had heard standing out
before her in letters of glaring fire.</p>

<p>"It can't be&mdash;it can't be!" she panted, leaning
forward as if she were speaking her passionate cry
into some listening ear. "It can't be! Olney Winthrop
murdered, and&mdash;Leith Pierrepont his&mdash;No,
no, no! It can not be true! My God! I will not
believe it! There is some awful mistake! Some
hideous blunder! But then&mdash;but then&mdash;"</p>

<p>She paused and moistened her stiff lips, her eyes
opening and closing curiously. She did not continue
that monologue, but catching hold of a
chair, then the foot of the bed, a table, then
another chair, she dragged herself to the fireside,
which had burned itself to little more than dull
gray ashes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span></p>

<p>She knelt upon the white bear-skin rug, and
taking the poker tried to stir it into a blaze again;
but the faint flicker made her shiver. She dropped
the poker from her cold fingers, and burying her
white face upon her knees crossed her arms around
them.</p>

<p>Her grief for her betrothed seemed to be swallowed
up in the awful sense of horror that oppressed
her. It was not so much of Olney Winthrop
murdered that she thought, as of Leith
Pierrepont murderer.</p>

<p>And then the shadows lengthened and dusk
faded into night. The poor fire died entirely and
lay gray and passionless upon the hearth. The
cold flash of an electric lamp shone through the
window, over which the shade had not been drawn,
and lay in a line of light across the floor, beyond
which were ponderous caverns made of shadow.</p>

<p>It was ghoulish, eerie.</p>

<p>She would have thought it strange that her maid
had not come to prepare her bath and bed if she
had been in a condition to consider ordinary subjects,
but matters of daily moment and time ceased
to exist for her during those hours.</p>

<p>Once or twice she moved uneasily, and a hoarse
moan left her lips as if some horrible thought, too
heavy to be borne in silence, weighed upon her
heart.</p>

<p>And then at last she lifted her head. The eyes
burned like living coals, but the face was gray and
passionless, like the dead ashes upon the hearth.
It was a curious, uncanny contrast.</p>

<p>Her neck was stiff and sore from its long continuance
in one position, but she did not seem to
be conscious of it. Her fingers were still interlaced
about her knee. Her mental faculties seemed to
return to her suddenly.</p>

<p>"He told me that he loved me, that whether I
desired or not, I should be his wife," she said in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
low, hoarse tone that fitted the scene with curious
horror, the "he" referring to Leith Pierrepont.
"Knowing that I was the betrothed wife of his
friend, he came in that friend's absence and made
his dastardly proposal to me. Can it be that he
has done this thing for&mdash;that? For that? In order
that he might carry out this hideous desire? Good
God! No human thing with the dim shadow of
blood in his veins could do a thing so vile. And
yet&mdash;God of Heaven, I will know! I must know!
I will avenge you, Olney! I swear it! Do you hear
me, sleeping there in your lonely grave? I swear
that I will avenge you, and that I will bring your
murderer to justice, let it cost me what it will of
womanliness, of self-respect, of life itself even. My
moment of weakness is passed, and the work shall
commence at once."</p>

<p>She arose, feverishly stiff and cramped from her
long, sorrowful vigil, and walked with a step that
was almost firm to the door.</p>

<p>It never occurred to her to consider the time,
but turning the key in the lock, she opened the
door and went into the hall.</p>

<p>All was dark, the house strangely still.</p>

<p>"It is out of respect for&mdash;Olney," she whispered
to herself, with a little catch in her voice like a
sob. "It was kind of Jessica! After all&mdash;"</p>

<p>She didn't finish the sentence, but walked unsteadily
up the hall. Her weakness seemed to
come again with her knowledge of the darkness.</p>

<p>She paused before Jessica's door and hesitated
for a moment, then she saw a faint gleam of light
beneath the door. It gave her courage. She did
not knock, but turned the knob gently. It yielded,
and the door swung back.</p>

<p>The brilliant gleam of light blinded her for a moment,
and then she saw Jessica standing beneath
the chandelier. She was clothed in a long gown of
shimmering greenish satin, the décolleté bodice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
finished with a fall of lace that somehow made her
look like a serpent which trails his long, singularly
graceful body in the moonlight. About her handsome
throat was a string of diamonds, and in the
clustering coils of auburn hair a crown of diamonds
that scintillated and flashed with defiant glitter.</p>

<p>And there was something in the cold look of the
brown eyes that matched them strangely&mdash;a look
that hardened as it rested upon the girl at the door.</p>

<p>She observed the expression of surprised contempt
in Carlita's burning eyes all too clearly, but
it only served to intensify her hatred.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I didn't know you had&mdash;been out," Carlita
stammered. "I half feared I should find you in
bed. The house was still and dark. Is it late?"</p>

<p>"No, early&mdash;in the morning," Jessica answered,
with a short laugh. "Haven't you been to bed?
It is almost three. There! the clock is striking
now."</p>

<p>"I had no idea&mdash;" returned Carlita, in an uncertain
and indefinite sort of way, as if she didn't
quite know what she wanted to say. "May I come
in for a moment?"</p>

<p>"As well come in and close the door as stand
there and have the draught blow on one," answered
Jessica. "It has been a very stupid evening,"
stifling a yawn. "Calve was not in voice, and
Jean de Reske didn't sing at all. It seems to me
abominably like a swindle to announce at the
last moment that some one whom you especially
went to hear 'has a cold, and So-and-so has
kindly consented to take his place.' Even the
poker game afterward was stupid&mdash;insufferably
stupid. Carlita, what a fool you are, that you don't
cut all the Puritan idiocy of your bringing up, and
try the gaits with me! You'd have twice the
friends, live twice as long, and have a thousand
times the fun."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span></p>

<p>Carlita shivered slightly, as her eyes traveled
over the figure before her.</p>

<p>"I suppose you are right," she said, half
stupidly; "but somehow it doesn't seem to be in
my line."</p>

<p>"Pouf! You can do anything you like. What's
the good of making a sepulcher of one's life&mdash;of
living for death, so to speak&mdash;when you have so
little of life and so much of death? You make a
constant sermon of yourself, and people hate sermons.
That's why they go to sleep in church.
You never see any one go to sleep at a poker-table.
There are people who talk against it, I
know&mdash;'wouldn't have their sisters play for their
right arms,' and all that rot&mdash;and then turn round
and kill their best friend!"</p>

<p>She laughed shortly, heavily, hatefully, and again
Carlita shivered, while she moved uneasily.</p>

<p>"It is inconsistent," she said, in a stony sort of
way; "but so few people are consistent. I wanted
to ask you about&mdash;him. You know&mdash;the man
whom&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Leith Pierrepont?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"What about him?"</p>

<p>"What did he tell you about&mdash;Olney? I fainted,
or&mdash;or something&mdash;and after that he had gone."</p>

<p>She was suffering too acutely to observe the
gleam in the red-brown eyes, and there was nothing
in the voice to attract attention.</p>

<p>"Olney is&mdash;dead. You know that?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes; he said that. But how?"</p>

<p>"Shot through the heart."</p>

<p>Carlita moistened her lips, and then continued
her grewsome questioning.</p>

<p>"And they buried him&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Out there."</p>

<p>"Was there an effort made to&mdash;to discover the
murderer?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span></p>

<p>"Effort? Oh, yes; I suppose so. But, after all,
what does 'effort' amount to in a place like that?
His murderer might have been standing right beside
the coffin, and no one would have made an
'effort' to arrest him. Leith Pierrepont himself
says that man's importance is measured there by
the number of men he has slain."</p>

<p>"Good heavens! He said that?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"The dastard!"</p>

<p>"It is doubly pitiful for poor Olney," Jessica
continued, volubly, "because he was so alone in
the world. There is no one to take his case for
him&mdash;no one to see that justice is done. The murder
was committed out of the country, and so the
murderer will go scot-free, deceiving other people,
his polluted body in contact with that of innocence&mdash;perhaps
even marry a pure young girl."</p>

<p>"No!" cried Carlita, her voice tragic in its suppressed
passion&mdash;"never! Olney is not without an
avenger. I have sworn before Heaven a solemn
vow that I will bring his murderer to punishment
for his cowardly crime; and I will keep that vow,
let it cost me what it will of happiness, of life, or
even honor. All the world shall know and scorn
him for the thing he is, and God Himself shall put
upon him the brand of Cain. I have sworn an oath
to Olney dead, and may I stand accursed before
Heaven if I fail to keep it!"</p>

<p>She went swiftly from the room, and Jessica
closed the door behind her, her low, strident laughter
filling the room with unmusical sound.</p>

<p>"I shall have my revenge upon both," she said,
with sardonic triumph&mdash;"my sweet revenge!"</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV.</a></h2>


<p>It seemed to Carlita that the dawn of morning
would never come. As well have undertaken any
other impossible feat as to sleep, and so she sat beside
the window watching eagerly, first for the
cold, gray break of light in the heavens, and next
for some movement in the other world to tell her
that mankind was astir again.</p>

<p>She was up, had had her bath, and dressed herself
when her maid arrived, pale, but with a fierce
burning in the dark eyes that made one forget the
circles round them.</p>

<p>"All dressed, Miss de Barryos!" exclaimed her
maid in some surprise. "You did not ring for me?"</p>

<p>"No, Ahbel," she returned, feverishly. "I
couldn't sleep, and there was no necessity of disturbing
you."</p>

<p>"But it is nine, and I have been up since seven.
You are too thoughtful for others and too little so
for yourself always, Miss de Barryos. And you
were ill last night? There was bad news?"</p>

<p>"Yes, from Mr. Winthrop."</p>

<p>"I know. Miss Chalmers' maid told me. We
are all so sorry, Miss de Barryos, sorry for you
as well as that misfortune should have befallen the
young gentleman."</p>

<p>"It is very kind of you, Ahbel," returned Carlita,
choking back a tearless sob which the tone of sympathy
in the voice evoked.</p>

<p>"And such a dreadful thing!" continued the girl.
"You can bear those things so much better when
one dies of a fever, or of something in one's bed.
It is so much more natural like. But to be&mdash;murdered!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span></p>

<p>The girl interrupted herself with a little shiver,
but Carlita neither shrank from the word nor
moved. She stood stonily, gazing with those
burning eyes into the street.</p>

<p>"It was very dreadful!" she said, dully.</p>

<p>"And do they know who did it?" continued the
girl.</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"But there must be some way of finding out. I
have heard such a lot of those people, Mexicans,
you know&mdash;worse than brigands. They don't want
to find out who did it; but a good smart Yankee
detective would ferret it all out quickly enough."</p>

<p>For the first time Carlita started.</p>

<p>"A detective!" she repeated.</p>

<p>"Yes'm. A good detective could go down there
and get at the bottom of facts in no time."</p>

<p>"Do you know a good detective, Ahbel?"</p>

<p>"Indeed I do, ma'am."</p>

<p>"You are quite sure he is a thoroughly reliable
man?"</p>

<p>"Quite sure, ma'am. He is considered one of
the very best in New York, and his word goes
further with the superintendent than any of them."</p>

<p>"Do you know where to find him?"</p>

<p>"Yes'm. He is my uncle. I was at his house
last night to see his daughter, my cousin. I came
to ask your permission, but Miss Chalmers said
you were not to be disturbed, and that if you required
anything, her maid could attend you."</p>

<p>But Carlita seemed not to have heard the latter
part of the speech.</p>

<p>"Would he be at home now?"</p>

<p>"Yes'm. He finished a case only yesterday, and
said he would take a few days' rest; but I know
he would do this for you, Miss de Barryos. He is
like an old war-horse, anyway. The mention of a
new mystery to solve is like the sound of a trumpet
to a horse. He gets restless in a moment."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span></p>

<p>"And you think he would be willing to risk the
danger of that country?"</p>

<p>"A good detective don't know the meaning of
danger, miss, any more than a good soldier does.
He won't stop to think of that."</p>

<p>"How soon can you fetch him here?"</p>

<p>"In an hour&mdash;perhaps less."</p>

<p>"Let it be less, if possible, and go at once."</p>

<p>"Yes'm."</p>

<p>"And you may bring him here upon your return.
Unless it should be necessary, you need say nothing
to any one of his presence here."</p>

<p>"I understand, miss. Shall I wait to bring your
breakfast?"</p>

<p>"No; tell Jawkins to serve it in the breakfast-room."</p>

<p>At least, it was something with which to occupy
the time until Ahbel's return. But a very poor occupation
it proved. Mental excitement and a sleepless
night are not conducive to excellence of appetite,
so that she did poor justice to the delicious
meal that was served her.</p>

<p>She returned to her own room when she could
bear the over-decoration of the breakfast-room no
longer, and waited restlessly, counting the apparently
endless moments as they passed. And
then, at last, she heard a quick step in the hall, a
light tap upon her door, and Ahbel stepped inside,
followed by a man, before Carlita had time to bid
them enter.</p>

<p>It was such a curious sensation that oppressed
her as she glanced from her maid to her maid's
uncle&mdash;a breathless excitement, subdued by a sort
of repulsion which was indefinable in her present
mood.</p>

<p>Ahbel's cheeks were crimson, her eyes sparkling,
under the excitement and an unusually brisk walk;
but it was toward the man that Carlita's most inquiring
glances were bent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span></p>

<p>He was rather small of stature&mdash;small and wiry&mdash;with
a smoothly shaved face, through which the
incipient black beard showed, making the skin
look blue. The hair was thick and very black,
contrasting oddly with the half-sunken cheeks.
But it was the eyes that gave him his extraordinary
appearance. They were deep set and small,
gray as to color, but so piercing, so penetrating,
as to make a comparatively innocent man tremble
as he looked into them.</p>

<p>He bowed profoundly as Ahbel introduced him
to her mistress.</p>

<p>"Miss de Barryos, this is my uncle, Edmond
Stolliker."</p>

<p>"Won't you sit down, Mr. Stolliker?" asked
Carlita, pointing toward a chair, and speaking to
her maid's uncle as if he were "to the manner
born"&mdash;well, perhaps, because a something about
him, unnamed but still apparent, compelled it.</p>

<p>He bowed again and took the chair she indicated
quietly and without any apparent awkwardness.</p>

<p>She seated herself opposite him, a table between
them, and nervously handled some of the ivory and
silver toilet articles that littered it.</p>

<p>"I have sent for you to&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Pardon me, Miss de Barryos," he interrupted,
speaking for the first time in a low voice which had
a curiously distinctive carrying power. "Is it your
desire that your maid should be present during this
interview?"</p>

<p>Carlita started slightly; but after the faintest
possible hesitation, turned to Ahbel, of whom the
detective had spoken as if she were the most absolute
stranger to him.</p>

<p>"You may go," she said, gently. "If I should
need you I will ring."</p>

<p>"Yes, miss."</p>

<p>She left the room without even a backward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
glance, and when the door closed, Carlita began
again:</p>

<p>"I suppose your niece told you of why I have
sent for you, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"She said something of the death of your fiancé,
which was thought to be murder; but I never like
to accept even the most apparently trifling detail
from one so little interested as a maid. If I am to
be retained in this case, Miss de Barryos, I must
receive all my data from you personally until I
can discover for myself."</p>

<p>"You understand, then, that this case will necessitate
a visit to Mexico?"</p>

<p>"Your maid told me as much."</p>

<p>"To the wildest and most uncivilized parts?"</p>

<p>Edmond Stolliker smiled. It warmed and genialized
his face wonderfully.</p>

<p>"Fortunately, I speak several patois of Spanish,"
he returned, by way of reply.</p>

<p>"Then you are willing to undertake it?"</p>

<p>"Quite."</p>

<p>"Then I will tell you the story, though the details
are meager enough&mdash;merely bald facts, I am
afraid. My fiancé, Mr. Olney Winthrop, was summoned
to Mexico concerning some mines in which
he was interested. He went, accompanied by a
friend of his, Mr. Leith Pierrepont. At first his
letters to me were filled with courage and hope;
then suddenly they ceased. Five or six weeks later&mdash;yesterday,
in fact&mdash;Mr. Pierrepont returned and
announced his death."</p>

<p>"From what?"</p>

<p>"Shot through the heart."</p>

<p>"Ah! Under what circumstances?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. I fainted when Mr. Pierrepont
told me, and on my recovery he had gone. The few
facts I have learned were through Miss Chalmers,
daughter of my guardian."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span></p>

<p>"But there is some one whom you suspect of this
murder?"</p>

<p>Carlita did not reply at once. Her dark eyes
blazed, her lips were scorched and parted, and
through them her hot breath came in little gasps;
yet when she could control herself sufficiently to
speak, she cried out passionately:</p>

<p>"Have I the right to speak suspicion?"</p>

<p>The detective leaned forward, almost touching
the small table between them, holding her spell-bound
by the strange gleam of his piercing eyes,
which seemed to be searching her very soul.</p>

<p>"Shall I tell you whom it is that you accuse in
your own heart, Miss de Barryos?" he asked, in a
tense half-whisper. "It is Leith Pierrepont! But
why? That is the question which I am most anxious
to have answered."</p>

<p>A crimson flush overspread her face from throat
to brow. She shrank backward in her seat, but the
detective leaned even further forward, touching the
table now with his long, slender fingers.</p>

<p>"Miss de Barryos," he continued, after a brief
pause, "if I am to do anything for you, you must
not begin by blindfolding me and then telling me
to see. A detective occupies much the same position
toward his client that a lawyer or doctor does.
He must be trusted all in all, or not at all. I am
not here through curiosity, but at your desire."</p>

<p>"You are right, and I all wrong," she cried out;
"but the subject is so hateful a one that I must
needs shrink from it. There is a reason why I suspect&mdash;the
man whom you have mentioned. He has
dared to speak to me of love, knowing that I was
the betrothed wife of the friend who trusted him as
a brother. He swore in my presence that, let what
would happen, I should be his wife. He is a man
whom I have never trusted&mdash;whom I despise; and
I believe he has done this cowardly thing in order
to carry out the vile oath that he swore."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span></p>

<p>The detective was watching her narrowly. She
had arisen, her face grown white again with passion,
her fingers clinched, a fierce gleam in the dark
eyes, which even he, with all his long experience
in the art of reading men, could not fathom.</p>

<p>"And so&mdash;he loves you!" Edmond Stolliker said,
musingly.</p>

<p>"If you would so desecrate the holy name."</p>

<p>"And when Mr. Winthrop was summoned to
Mexico this man went with him?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Why? Were his mining interests also jeopardized?"</p>

<p>"He had none there."</p>

<p>"Ah! That is a significant fact, certainly. Did
Mr. Winthrop write you anything of the condition
in which he found his affairs there?"</p>

<p>"His last letter stated that he had not yet discovered
why he had been summoned at all, as matters
seemed to him in a more prosperous condition
than they had ever been."</p>

<p>"Umph! Will you let me see that letter?"</p>

<p>She hesitated a moment, unwilling to trust so
sacred a thing to other hands; then remembering
her oath, she went feverishly to her escritoire. As
she was selecting it, a knock sounded upon the
door, and Ahbel entered.</p>

<p>"Mr. Pierrepont, Miss de Barryos," she exclaimed,
striving to calm the excitement of her
tone.</p>

<p>Carlita turned like a tigress, the precious letters
dropping from her hands to the floor about her.</p>

<p>"Tell him," she cried, passionately, "that Miss
de Barryos is not at home to him, neither now nor
ever!"</p>

<p>Edmond Stolliker was upon his feet in a moment.</p>

<p>"Wait!" he exclaimed, in command, to the maid;
then crossed the room suddenly and stood facing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
Miss de Barryos. "If we are to discover the murderer
of your fiancé, Miss de Barryos," he said,
earnestly, "you must be my unfailing ally. You
must obey me absolutely. This man must suspect
nothing whatever of your intentions. He must
suppose that you believe every word that he speaks.
He must even believe there might come a time
when you would not be unfavorable to his suit.
You must see him whenever he calls; keep him
near you at whatever cost. If you would discover
the murderer of your fiancé, you must be an
actress as strong and subtle as Bernhardt herself,
forgetting your own inclinations and hatreds, and
thinking only of Olney Winthrop dead, and needing
an avenger. You feel yourself capable of
this?"</p>

<p>"Of anything that will insure justice to the dead
and to the living!"</p>

<p>"Ahbel, say to Mr. Pierrepont that Miss de Barryos
will be down at once," the detective said,
quietly. "Is there any convenient cover from
which I could hear a conversation between you?"</p>

<p>"Yes; the conservatory."</p>

<p>"Good! Let no detail escape. Ask him every
question that you can put with safety, without allowing
him to suspect that it is for greater cause
than your natural interest. You can do this?"</p>

<p>"For Olney's sake."</p>

<p>Her eyes were lifted, her hands pressed upon her
bosom as if she were communing with her dead
lover. Her lips moved for a moment, and then she
left the room.</p>

<p>Edmond Stolliker gathered up the letters she
had dropped, thrust them into his pocket, and followed.</p>

<p>In the hall he met Ahbel.</p>

<p>"Take me to the conservatory, quick!" he commanded,
briefly.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV.</a></h2>


<p>Carlita had never in her life undertaken anything
so difficult as her entrance into that room.
She was forced to stop outside the door in order to
gain some control over her trembling lips, that she
might speak the name and meet the eye of the man
whom she felt she hated with all the strength of
her soul.</p>

<p>It gave Edmond Stolliker time to gain his position
in the conservatory, and enabled him to witness
the greeting.</p>

<p>He could have desired nothing better.</p>

<p>She entered quietly, her long black robe trailing
after her girlish figure in fascinating contrast, and
Stolliker observed all too clearly the whitening and
compression of Pierrepont's lips as he went toward
her in the old indolent, graceful fashion.</p>

<p>"I half feared you would not receive me, that
you might be ill," he said, putting out his large,
beautifully shaped white hand to take her cold fingers.
"It was very good of you."</p>

<p>"I wanted&mdash;so much to know&mdash;all&mdash;you know&mdash;all
that concerns&mdash;him," she faltered, in exactly the
tone Stolliker would have had her use had he been
able to suggest it. "I don't believe I have been in
bed since&mdash;since you were here, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I was a brute," he interrupted, not looking at
her&mdash;a fact which Stolliker observed, "to tell you
so abruptly. I wanted to ask your forgiveness.
There are times, you know, when a man forgets&mdash;everything,
and is almost pardonable."</p>

<p>He had placed a chair for her before the fire,
and she had sat down, her eyes fixed upon the
blaze. She felt that a glance into his face would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
have dispersed all her courage, and she dared not
risk it. But she knew that Stolliker would lose no
point.</p>

<p>Leith did not sit. He stood with his elbow upon
the mantel-shelf, his head supported by his
closed hand, looking into the fire also. Once he
glanced toward her, moved nervously, and allowed
his eyes to return to the fire again.</p>

<p>Stolliker grunted a curious "Umph!"</p>

<p>The silence grew unbearable at last.</p>

<p>"Won't you&mdash;go on?" Carlita asked, wistfully.
"Won't you tell me without&mdash;without questioning?
It is so hard, so hard!"</p>

<p>"You loved him&mdash;so&mdash;then?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I loved him," she answered, with quivering
passion.</p>

<p>He glanced toward her again, but Stolliker could
not quite determine what the expression in his
quickly averted eyes could have been; whether
pity, sorrow, remorse, or all three blended, but he
distinctly saw the shiver that passed through the
magnificent frame.</p>

<p>"I wish I could help you, but it is too late for
that," he said, heavily. "Poor little girl! After
all, Olney is to be envied, for at least you have
loved him."</p>

<p>"You saw him&mdash;die?" she interrupted in a choking
voice, utterly unable to keep silent and listen
longer.</p>

<p>"No; he was&mdash;dead when&mdash;when I reached his
side."</p>

<p>He had drawn himself up, stiffened, so to speak,
as if nerving himself for a terrible trial.</p>

<p>"Then he left no message for me? Spoke no
word?"</p>

<p>Pierrepont moved uneasily.</p>

<p>"He&mdash;he could not," he answered, hoarsely.
"There was no time."</p>

<p>"He was shot&mdash;Jessica told me that."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"And through the heart?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"I shall always hate them&mdash;my people&mdash;that they
should have done so vile a thing, committed so
causeless a murder. And there was no reason, was
there?"</p>

<p>She lifted her eyes for the first time and saw the
crimson flush that glowed upon his cheeks, the
flush of shame. He hesitated for a moment, then
answered heavily:</p>

<p>"None."</p>

<p>For a moment it seemed to her that she must cry
out, that she must brand him "murderer;" but she
subdued the wild desire by a wilder effort. She interlaced
her fingers on her lap, and held herself
closely for strength, then she summoned all her
histrionic powers, as Stolliker had instructed her,
and leaned slightly toward him.</p>

<p>"You have been&mdash;his friend&mdash;my friend, though
I have been foolish enough not to recognize it
until now," she said, loathing herself for the deception
and yet continuing it. "But you will forgive
me for all that and help me, will you not? You
will be my friend in future as you were his in the
past?"</p>

<p>He turned toward her eagerly, but controlled
himself suddenly, and answered quietly, but with
deep emotion:</p>

<p>"It is greater happiness than&mdash;I deserve."</p>

<p>"And you do forgive me?"</p>

<p>"If there were anything to forgive, with all my
heart; but it is I who have always been the offender,
not you."</p>

<p>"I am so alone, and&mdash;and he was all&mdash;I had!"
she exclaimed, repressing a sob, which was, nevertheless,
very audible.</p>

<p>"Do you think I did not understand that?" he
cried, passionately. "Do you think there was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
single word or act of yours that I did not comprehend?
Why&mdash;There! Forgive me. I don't quite
know myself of late. I am like some foolish, hot-headed
boy, the yielding tool of every emotion. I
wish I could make you understand how I appreciate
the sweet trust of your generous friendship."</p>

<p>He took a step toward her, and placing his hand
upon the back of her chair, bent downward until
his lips almost touched her hair&mdash;not quite.</p>

<p>A tremor passed throughout her body, but she
did not move.</p>

<p>"You accept it?" she asked, her voice little more
than a whisper.</p>

<p>"As I would a pardon from God."</p>

<p>She started ever so slightly, but controlled herself
again.</p>

<p>"And you will help me?" she asked in the same
low tone.</p>

<p>"In all things so far as in my power lies."</p>

<p>"Thank you! thank you!" she murmured, lifting
her intertwined fingers from her lap to her breast,
and shrinking downward away from him just a
trifle. "You will understand how I feel. You do
not wish, any more than I, that he should sleep out
there&mdash;in that lonely grave. You will help me to
bring&mdash;his body here, and&mdash;and to find his murderer?"</p>

<p>Stolliker caught his breath hard as he watched
the man&mdash;watched the cold, gray loam overspread
his face&mdash;watched the stiffening of the joints and
the slow lifting of the graceful form to an upright
position.</p>

<p>The gray eyes were bent upon the dark head
with an expression of horror which it was not necessary
he should conceal, as she was not looking;
but Stolliker observed that he pressed his hand
above his heart, as if he feared she might hear its
beating.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I can't promise&mdash;that," he stammered helplessly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
"It is so&mdash;useless. Of course, I will do all
I can; but you can't understand the&mdash;the condition
of the railroads there. It would be impossible&mdash;simply
impossible&mdash;now, at least."</p>

<p>"Then&mdash;then later, when the&mdash;the condition of
the country&mdash;has improved?" she gasped, hoarsely;
and for a moment Stolliker feared she was going
to faint.</p>

<p>"Yes, later," he assented, huskily.</p>

<p>"But&mdash;but the other?" she cried, almost fiercely.
"You will help me with the other&mdash;you will help
me to find his murderer?"</p>

<p>There was another silence, long and ominous.
Somehow, Leith was leaning upon the mantel-shelf
again, though neither Stolliker nor Carlita could
have told how he got there.</p>

<p>"You don't know what you are asking," he said
at last, in a dull, tense voice. "The place is so
wild, so unreal. Wait for awhile. Wait until you
have got over the first shock&mdash;the first horror of it
all. Then, if you wish it, I will help you."</p>

<p>And with that she was apparently content.</p>

<p>"I may come again?" he asked shortly afterward,
as he was leaving; and, mindful of Stolliker's
words and her own oath, she answered:</p>

<p>"Yes, you may come again."</p>

<p>He pressed her hand and left her silently, passing
out into the hall and out of the house without
seeing Jessica's mocking face at the head of the
stairs, though he might not have understood the
scornful, triumphant smile upon it, even if he had.</p>

<p>He wearily closed the hall door upon himself,
and as he slowly descended the stoop, he lifted his
hat and pushed the damp hair back from his forehead.</p>

<p>"God!" he muttered, half aloud, "if I had suspected
half how hard it would be, I should never
have undertaken it even for her. Ay, verily, 'whom
the gods would destroy they first make mad.'"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span></p>

<p>Stolliker watched him down the street, then
joined Carlita upon the hearth-rug.</p>

<p>"I have to congratulate you upon playing your
part superbly!"</p>

<p>"You heard&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Everything."</p>

<p>"Bah!"&mdash;with a shiver of repulsion&mdash;"it was a
hateful part, a despicable part&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But one that is absolutely essential if you
would discover and bring to justice the murderer
of your betrothed husband."</p>

<p>"Then you think&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Pardon me; detectives have no right to 'think.'
They must know. You have given me a clew, and
it is worth working out; that is all. In the meantime,
your part in the drama is to keep this man
beside you as much as possible, night and day.
Watch his most minute act, his lightest word, and
report them all to me&mdash;everything. Let nothing escape.
Don't trust your memory for a single day,
but write everything down the moment he has
gone. Take care that no act or word of his shall
betray you into any exhibition of suspicion; and,
above all, don't reject too much his overtures of
affection. That part you must play with great
care and finesse, neither being too quickly won nor
too cold in your demeanor. You think you can
assist me so far?"</p>

<p>"I will do it&mdash;that, or anything that may be required
of me to bring this man to a punishment
of his foul crime."</p>

<p>"Good!"</p>

<p>"And in the meantime, you&mdash;what will you be
doing?"</p>

<p>"I? Oh, I shall start for Mexico by the first
train that goes. These letters will give me all the
data for that that I shall require."</p>

<p>"You have them&mdash;Mr. Winthrop's letters?"</p>

<p>"Every one, I think."</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVI" id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI.</a></h2>


<p>Before leaving for Mexico there was a long, detailed
conversation between Stolliker and Carlita, a
conversation in which he fully outlined to her the
part it would be necessary for her to play&mdash;a line
of action to which she offered no word of objection,
though her whole soul rebelled against such
duplicity.</p>

<p>There was also a telegraph code agreed upon,
by which cipher telegrams could be sent; a method
used before, but always comparatively safe. A
book was mutually agreed upon, in this instance
"The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes," by Conan
Doyle. The word, counting from the bottom of
the page, was to be indicated by the first number,
the page itself by the second; so that to read it
would be impossible, unless the reader knew to
what volume the numbers referred, as well as the
edition selected.</p>

<p>They understood each other perfectly when Stolliker
left to catch his train, and in his own mind
there was not a doubt but that he should be able
to prove Pierrepont's guilt with almost greater
ease than he had ever settled a case before.</p>

<p>"It's too pretty a neck to be bound by a halter,"
he mused, as he took his seat in the train. "Adam
lost Eden because of a woman&mdash;a woman who
loved him; but this man will lose more than that,
if I mistake not. He will lose not alone his life,
but his soul as well, and for a woman who loves
him not! It is a queer world, and man is the
queerest animal in it. Instead of conscience making
cowards of us all, passion makes brutes of us
all, and we forget conscience and cowardice, too,
under the intoxicant of a woman's smile."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span></p>

<p>After Stolliker had gone, the excitement which
had seemed to brace Carlita for the emergency suddenly
wore itself out, and for several days she was
confined to her room, with a nearer approach to
fever than she had ever had in her strong, healthy
young life before.</p>

<p>It was during those few days that a strange
change came over Jessica.</p>

<p>She developed a sudden affection for her
mother's ward that touched that poor, friendless
young thing to the heart. She even refused to go
to the opera the night that Carlita was threatened
with delirium, and sat beside the bed, holding
Carlita's hand while the physician was in the
room, and bending over the patient once or twice
with tenderest solicitude when there was a murmur
of a name upon those rambling lips which
she did not wish the doctor to hear.</p>

<p>And Jessica learned much in those few days,
much that it would have been a thousand times
better if she had never known; but Carlita was
unaware of that.</p>

<p>She lifted the girl's hand to her cooling lips, and
pressed it there passionately when she realized
who it was that had nursed her so carefully.</p>

<p>"How shall I thank you?" she murmured,
faintly. "I don't think I have ever appreciated
before how good you are!"</p>

<p>"Perhaps we have never quite understood each
other before," returned Jessica, in that low, melodious
voice which none knew better than she how
to assume.</p>

<p>"Ah, yes, it is that," answered Carlita, eagerly.
"But now that I know how tender your friendship
can be, you will not withdraw it from me? I am
so alone, so pitifully alone in all the world! There
is not one creature that belongs to me, not one
that cares whether I live or die, not one to whom
I could stretch out my hand for help, no matter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
what my needs may be. It seems to me sometimes
that my heart will break from the heaviness
of its loneliness and isolation. Let me love you,
Jessica! Let me love you!"</p>

<p>There was a peculiar smile upon the Judas lips,
a smile filled with fascination&mdash;a fascination which
she was exerting upon that helpless girl as she
had upon so many men, luring them to eternal
ruin, and then she bent and pressed a Judas kiss
upon Carlita's tremulous lips.</p>

<p>"You silly little sentimentalist!" she exclaimed,
laughingly. "I should always have been your
friend if you had not repelled my advances with
such determination. There now"&mdash;moving the pillows
into a more comfortable position&mdash;"we won't
talk about it any more. You are weak and nervous.
The first thing I know you will cry, then I
shall cry, and then I shall never forgive you as
long as I live for making my nose red. Did you
ever read in a novel about how beautiful the
heroine looks when she cries? That is the baldest
kind of rot! I never saw a girl in my life who
looked pretty when she cried. I am not presentable
for hours afterward."</p>

<p>It was a charity in its way, this new friendship,
for in spite of its odious treachery on one side, it
kept Carlita from going mad in those first days,
and later gave her courage to play the part which
Stolliker had mapped out for her.</p>

<p>At the end of the fifth day Stolliker reached the
City of Mexico. He telegraphed from there, but
there was nothing beyond the statement of his
arrival.</p>

<p>On the seventh Carlita was up and about again,
very wan, very haggard, but still on the road to
recovery.</p>

<p>She felt that there was no longer any time to be
lost in carrying out Stolliker's injunctions; and so,
when Leith Pierrepont's card was brought to her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
two days later, she arose and went wearily downstairs.</p>

<p>"How you have suffered!" Leith exclaimed, as
his eyes fell upon her.</p>

<p>Her own burned fiercely, and her lips trembled
so that she could find no words in which to answer
him.</p>

<p>He pressed her hand in silence, and led her to
the same chair she had occupied that day when
Stolliker was in the conservatory.</p>

<p>"It is so good of you to receive me," he continued,
after a painful pause. "In memory of our
compact of friendship, I have called every day to
ask after you.'"</p>

<p>Her heart gave a great passionate bound, a mad
bound of anger, at his presumption, she told herself;
but her tone was calm, even serene, as she
replied to him:</p>

<p>"Really? I was not told. Perhaps it was forgotten.
It was very good of you to take so much
trouble. Every one has been singularly kind and
just, when I was fancying myself so cruelly alone,
too."</p>

<p>"Never alone so long as you will consider me
your friend."</p>

<p>"That is two I have now."</p>

<p>"Two? Who is the other?"</p>

<p>"Jessica."</p>

<p>"Oh!"</p>

<p>A shadow of disappointment crossed his brow, a
disappointment which he made no attempt to conceal.</p>

<p>She laughed nervously.</p>

<p>"Jessica tells me that I have been such a fool,"
she said, in a tone that was quite new to her.</p>

<p>"Indeed? How?"</p>

<p>"She calls me 'little Puritan,' and says that my
absurd morality has a Plymouth Rock cast. She
has told me the reason I have but two friends."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span></p>

<p>"Has she? What is it?"</p>

<p>"It is because I am too intense for this day and
generation. People don't like it. Frivolity and
lightness of heart are much more to their taste."</p>

<p>"But what of your nature? Does that count for
nothing? Is that not to be taken into consideration?"</p>

<p>"One's nature is a matter of education, nothing more.
If that has been faulty, it should be rectified
as quickly as possible."</p>

<p>"May I ask how she proposes that you shall
rectify these defects of education?"</p>

<p>"Why, simply by imitating other people at first."</p>

<p>"Herself, for example?"</p>

<p>"Certainly."</p>

<p>"By playing poker after the opera, you mean?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps, though not necessarily. You do not
approve?"</p>

<p>"I approve of a woman or man following the
bent of her or his own particular predilection," he
answered, evasively. "If you approve of playing
poker, I have nothing to say."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But&mdash;I should be very sorry," he said, sadly.</p>

<p>"You would&mdash;withdraw from that compact of
friendship?"</p>

<p>"No; I should feel that you needed me all the
more, and I should be in constant attendance, lest
the moment should arrive in my absence when you
might want my services most."</p>

<p>She looked up at him with a faint smile, into
which she would have thrown more archness had
the power to do so been given her, and exclaimed,
playfully:</p>

<p>"You offer inducement rather than opposition."</p>

<p>He flushed and drew back slightly, something in
word, or tone, or glance jarring upon his emotion.
Somehow he preferred her coldest disdain to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
remark that she had made, and yet there was nothing
in it to give offense to any man.</p>

<p>He walked to the other side of the fire, behind
her chair, and changed the subject suddenly.</p>

<p>"When shall you be able to take up your music
again?" he asked, irrelevantly.</p>

<p>"Soon, I hope," she answered, but with a little
shiver.</p>

<p>He saw it, and his conscience smote him. He
believed that he had wronged her.</p>

<p>"Carlita!" he cried, unconscious that in his pain
he had used her first name. "Carlita, don't allow a
morose and morbid desire to conceal your real
emotions make you false to yourself and all those
higher and better attributes with which God has
blessed you. You have sustained a terrible shock.
Don't let it turn the very beauties of your sweet
nature into a curse. You want something to turn
to in your hour of trouble. Let it be your music.
God gave you a talent which He intended as a
comfort and sustaining power. Call upon it now.
May I play to you?"</p>

<p>She did not reply, she could not; but already he
had wandered toward the piano. He sat down absent-mindedly
and passed his hands over the keys.</p>

<p>It reminded them both of that other evening
when he had played for her, and they sang together,
that evening when he had told her of a love
of which he had no right to speak, which had no
right to exist. A great, wild, turbulent passion
rose up in his heart against himself, numbing his
fingers.</p>

<p>For the first time within his remembrance the
keys beneath his hands gave forth a discordant
sound.</p>

<p>He stood up suddenly and looked at her.</p>

<p>She too had arisen.</p>

<p>Her eyes were fierce, burning with raging passion.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
He thought he knew what thoughts were at
work in her brain, and cried out feverishly:</p>

<p>"God! How can a man live to curse himself
for a momentary yielding to madness! Do you believe
there is any forgiveness for it? Do you believe
there is forgiveness for any sin, when the person
against whom you have sinned is dead, when
he can no longer hear you cry out your passionate
remorse?"</p>

<p>She did not reply. She rose ghastly in her horrible
pallor, and stood there shaking and trembling
as if an awful ague had fallen upon her. She was
striving to loosen her cleaving tongue when Jessica
came into the room suddenly, with a swish of
skirts and a bound that startled her.</p>

<p>"Halloo, Leith!" she exclaimed, in the old slangy
way. "Glad to see you back again. The house
has been like a funeral. Look at Carlita! Like a
ghost, isn't she? And you tiring her out by allowing
her to stand in this way. If you had been either a
good physician or a good nurse, you would have
drawn up that couch and have her comfortably
bolstered up with pillows. Now, I'm going to send
her upstairs, just because you have been so
thoughtless."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid I deserve the punishment," he answered,
meekly. "But if I promise not to do it in
future you won't banish me, will you?"</p>

<p>"Not to any alarming extent," she returned,
laughing. "Here you are, Ahbel! Take our patient
upstairs, see that she is nicely tucked up and
has a good rest. And now, sir, give an account of
yourself. Where have you been this last week?"</p>

<p>But Carlita did not hear his reply.</p>

<p>Ahbel had led her from the room to her own,
where she suddenly sat down beside the window.</p>

<p>"Leave me, Ahbel!" she cried, nervously. "I'll
ring if I want you, but I couldn't lie down now. I
must think! I must think!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span></p>

<p>She didn't even know when the girl left the
room, but, with her hands clinched in her lap, sat
looking half frantically out of the window.</p>

<p>What was it, she was asking herself, that he
would have told her when Jessica entered? Could
it have been a confession of his guilt? Would a
guilty man have so spoken? What was it he
meant? Was he innocent or guilty?</p>

<p>And, as if in answer to her unspoken question, a
knock came upon the door, quick, incisive, as if
the seeker for permission to enter realized the importance
of her errand.</p>

<p>It was Ahbel.</p>

<p>"A telegram, miss!" she exclaimed, half breathlessly.</p>

<p>Carlita received it and tore it open hastily. It
looked ordinary enough as it trembled in her hand,
and yet there was something sinister in the array
of figures as she flashed her eyes over them:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"2, 75, 107, 29, 12, 35, 18, 134; 24, 23, 18, 11, 126,
29, 23, 22, 55, 10, 324, 51, 23, 50, 135, 114, 45, 116,
19, 97, 17, 78, 4, 97."</p></blockquote>

<p>Scarcely able to control her excitement, she sped
across the floor to her escritoire, and snatched up
the volume of "Sherlock Holmes" concealed there.</p>

<p>With trembling fingers she turned the pages and
slowly counted out the words, horrible, ghastly in
their import:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The gentleman to whom you were engaged was
not shot as you were told.</p>

<p class="sig1">
E. S."<br />
</p></blockquote>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVII" id="CHAPTER_XVII">CHAPTER XVII.</a></h2>


<p>Breathless, with alternate flashes of heat and
cold traveling over her with such rapidity that unconsciousness
was threatened, Carlita sat there
staring at the words represented by the numbers
in that telegram, understanding all the horrible
import of it, yet unable to think connectedly after
the first shock, until finally she flung up her hands
and covered her wretched face passionately.</p>

<p>"Why should it affect me like this?" she cried,
as if some awful hatred of herself were at work in
her heart. "Why should it affect me like this?
I knew that Leith Pierrepont was guilty of murder&mdash;knew
it as well before as I know it now&mdash;and
yet&mdash;and yet hope must have been at work within
me, for this additional proof of his guilt is maddening.
Why should he lie, if it were not he
that committed the crime? Why should he wish
to deceive me as to the manner of Olney's death?
Good God! it seems impossible that a human
creature, one of Thine own creation, could be so
base; and yet it must be so&mdash;it must be so!"</p>

<p>And yet, for all her self-assurance, she snatched
up the book again and once more toiled through
the numbers, counting them out more slowly, more
carefully, than she had done before, and feeling
the hideous depression creeping over her with
renewed horror as she realized that she had made
no mistake.</p>

<p>And then, trembling so that she could scarcely
hold the volume, she compiled a telegram to Edmond
Stolliker in reply:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I don't understand your message. Have you
had body disinterred, and what does the knowledge
imply? Answer at once if you have reason still to
believe the man whom we suspect to be guilty."</p></blockquote>

<p>She felt better when it had been dispatched by
Ahbel, with the injunction to the telegraph operator
to be sure there should be no mistake made
in the numbers; still she could not rest, but walked
up and down the room, up and down, like the
tigress that chafes against confining bars.</p>

<p>Half an hour afterward Jessica entered, her smile
more fascinating than ever.</p>

<p>"Not lying down, as I commanded, you naughty
girl!" exclaimed the female Judas, playfully taking
Carlita by the shoulders and forcing her into a
chair. "I actually feel inclined to dismiss your
careless maid. What's the matter? You look in a
fever of excitement."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid I am," admitted Carlita, with a wan
smile. "I wish you'd let me go out for a little
drive or&mdash;or&mdash;something. I feel as if the house
were suffocating me!"</p>

<p>"A drive? Why, certainly; and I'll go with you,
if you'll have me. I'll order the carriage at once,"
suiting the action to the word and ringing the bell.
"What has upset you like this? Some news since
you left the drawing-room? Ah, I see! a telegram.
May I read it?"</p>

<p>She lifted the paper without waiting for permission,
and made a little wry face.</p>

<p>"Great Scott!" she exclaimed, laughing. "What's
all this algebra about? No, that's wrong; for, in
algebra, letters stands for figures, and here figures
must stand for letters. What does it mean,
dearie?"</p>

<p>Carlita had arisen and stood facing her, her great
burning eyes fixed upon the calm ones before her.
Her cheeks were crimson with the excitement that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
seemed consuming her, and, leaning forward, she
placed her hot fingers upon Jessica's cool wrist.</p>

<p>"I wonder if I dare trust you?" she whispered,
feverishly. "I wonder if I dare tell you what that
telegram contains?"</p>

<p>Jessica smiled again. It was such a curious
smile. It might have startled, and would have
certainly puzzled, Carlita had she been in an
analytical frame of mind; but she was too much
upset mentally to think of that.</p>

<p>"Trust me!" exclaimed Jessica in a tone that
simulated offense admirably. "If you have any
doubts upon the subject, perhaps you had better
not."</p>

<p>"Oh, forgive me!" cried Carlita, regretfully. "I
am in too great distress to consider my words carefully,
and I thought you would understand. We
have grown to be so much to each other in these
last few days&mdash;or weeks, is it? Let me tell you,
will you not, dear Jessica? You know the solemn
oath that I have sworn, and you will help me?"</p>

<p>"You mean about Olney?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>Jessica did not reply. A knock came in answer
to her ring just then, and pushing Carlita back into
her chair again, she answered the summons, then
drew another chair up in front of her mother's
ward.</p>

<p>"You startle me," she said, gently.</p>

<p>"I, too, am startled&mdash;frightened," answered Carlita,
shivering. "Here is the translation of those
figures&mdash;read it."</p>

<p>Jessica took the paper into her hand, and read
aloud:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The gentleman to whom you were engaged was
not shot as you were told."</p></blockquote>

<p>The paper fluttered from her hand. She lifted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
her eyes and allowed them to rest upon Carlita's,
heavy, dull with apprehension. She was a magnificent
actress.</p>

<p>There was a long, dense silence between them,
then Jessica's lips moved slowly.</p>

<p>"What does it mean?" she gasped, hoarsely.
"What under heaven could have induced him to lie?"</p>

<p>Once again Carlita leaned forward, her scorching
fingers touching Jessica's wrist in an uncanny sort
of way that made the latter shiver.</p>

<p>"The truth is not upon the lips of&mdash;a guilty
man," she answered, in a hollow, unnatural tone.
"Forgive me, Jessica, but I heard your words the
night he came with his awful story of Olney's&mdash;death.
I heard you accuse&mdash;him to your mother.
I know that you, too, believe him guilty."</p>

<p>She paused, but Jessica did not speak. She
waited for her to continue, and after a moment the
hollow voice went on:</p>

<p>"I went down to see him, hoping to hear more,
and I heard you instead, accusing him to your
mother. It has been a bond of sympathy between
us. I have loved you because I knew you must
hate him as I do."</p>

<p>"And yet you continue to receive him!" exclaimed
the arch-hypocrite, half reproachfully.</p>

<p>She was scarcely prepared for the excitement her
words provoked. Carlita sprang to her feet and
walked hastily up and down the room, her hands
clasping and unclasping, her cheeks crimson, her
breath coming in little gasps.</p>

<p>"I know that you will hate me even as I hate
myself for the despicable part that is forced upon
me, but it is only to prove his guilt that I have
undertaken it. It is only to bring him to a punishment
of his dastardly crime; and, despise myself
as I will&mdash;let the whole world despise me if
it must&mdash;I shall play the part to the bitter end!"</p>

<p>She was at the other end of the room and could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
not see the hateful, cunning smile that lurked about
the corners of Jessica's mouth as she said, quietly:</p>

<p>"Then you know that he loves you?"</p>

<p>The beautiful, majestic head was bowed for a
moment in shame, as the quivering voice replied:</p>

<p>"Yes, I know it."</p>

<p>"He told you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Before Olney left for Mexico."</p>

<p>"He asked you to&mdash;be his wife?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>There was the old gleam of the serpent in the
brown eyes, the greenish glare that Carlita must
have understood had she been looking; but she was
not.</p>

<p>Neither of them spoke for some moments. Carlita
had paused, and was looking, in a distracted
way, through the window, seeing nothing of the
world that was stretched out before her.</p>

<p>Jessica arose and stood beside her before she was
conscious of her approach. The curious tone of
the hissing voice caused her to shrink away in a
sort of nameless terror as the words reached her:</p>

<p>"And you want to prove his guilt; is that it?"</p>

<p>She hesitated for a moment&mdash;it seemed so
ghastly, so unreal, so impossible&mdash;and then her
voice came in a hoarse whisper:</p>

<p>"Yes, that is it."</p>

<p>"I will help you!" cried Jessica, in a voice filled
with a desire for revenge so strong that it could
not be subdued. "I will help you! I know a man
down there, an old friend of the family. He
will assist us. You think you have not a friend. I
can see more clearly than you, because I&mdash;do not&mdash;suffer.
You were right when you said that I
believed in his guilt, and we will punish him&mdash;you
and I&mdash;as man was never punished before. Meriaz
will help us."</p>

<p>"How can I ever thank you!" cried Carlita,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
grasping the hand that was not withdrawn from
her.</p>

<p>Jessica smiled enigmatically.</p>

<p>"I do not care for thanks. Only let me help
you," she answered in the same tone, that somehow
sent a chill to Carlita's heart.</p>

<p>Then she turned away to answer a knock at the
door.</p>

<p>"The carriage is ready, Miss Chalmers," the
servant announced, "and a telegram for Miss de
Barryos."</p>

<p>She had the telegram in her hand and the door
closed almost before the sentence had been completed.</p>

<p>Carlita flew across the room and seized it, her
cheeks glowing more crimson than ever, then fading
to ashen white.</p>

<p>"Help me!" she gasped. "There is the book.
Count the words from the bottom of the page while
I read the numbers aloud to you."</p>

<p>And placing both her weapons and ammunition
in the hands of her deadliest enemy, they translated
together the words:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Body disinterred. Murder committed by suffocation.
Everything points to person suspected.
The necessity to play your part with consummate
skill is greater than ever. Take care, and trust no
one.</p>

<p class="sig1">
E. S."<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>But the warning had come too late.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVIII" id="CHAPTER_XVIII">CHAPTER XVIII.</a></h2>


<p>The shock of the telegram seemed to impart to
Carlita the strength she required for action.</p>

<p>She felt a new vitality, new courage pouring
through her like the false, effervescent strength<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
from wine, but she did not recognize its falsity.
She felt herself capable of anything to bring Leith
Pierrepont to justice, to bring to the gallows the
craven coward that had robbed Olney Winthrop
of life.</p>

<p>"The carriage is here; let us go out!" she cried
feverishly to Jessica. "I can be ready in five
minutes."</p>

<p>She arose and placed the two telegrams with
their translations in her desk, together with the
volume of "The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes,"
and locked it carefully, while Jessica went away to
her own room.</p>

<p>To her surprise she found her mother standing
there, her hands pressed upon her breast, her haggard
eyes wild with fear.</p>

<p>"What are you doing here?" cried Jessica,
roughly, now that there was no longer a necessity
to oil her treacherous tongue. "You look like a
fright! Ever since that milk-sop, Olney, was reported
murdered, you have gone about like an
uneasy ghost. You've even neglected your hair
until there is a black stripe as wide as my fingers
down the middle of your head. For the Lord's
sake, pull yourself together, and stop acting like
a frightened school miss who has found a mouse
nibbling at her bread and butter. Go and color
your hair!"</p>

<p>"Jessica, have you no heart at all? What is it
that you intend to do? Oh, I wish to God I had
never consented to allow the child of another
woman to come into our household. I wish&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, let up!" interrupted her respectful daughter,
carelessly. "You've done it, and there is no
use in grieving over spilled milk. We've got her
money, and I'll have a darned sight more of it before
I get through with life, or I'll miss my reckoning."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span></p>

<p>"Jessica! Jessica, for the love of Heaven! what
is it that you mean to do?"</p>

<p>"Oh, rot! Don't stand there wringing your
hands and whining like a whipped cur. If you had
any blood in your veins you would help me, and
not make difficulties the greater. What do I mean
to do?"&mdash;her face darkening cruelly&mdash;"I mean to
have the deepest and most complete revenge upon
those two that woman ever planned. I have
thought it all out carefully and well, and the best
of it is, that she shall execute my every wish. I
mean to ruin her body and soul. And as for him&mdash;well,
his punishment shall remain my secret. And
now there is something that I want you to do."</p>

<p>"Oh, Jessica, I can not! I&mdash;"</p>

<p>The girl turned swiftly and caught her mother
by the wrist, her fingers closing upon it like bands
of steel. Her eyes, burning in their fierce wrath,
looked into those shrinking ones, and her voice
came in a heavy, hoarse whisper:</p>

<p>"You will obey me, do you hear? You will obey
me, or&mdash;"</p>

<p>She did not complete the threat. It was not
necessary. The haggard eyes had dropped. A
slow shiver had passed over the elder woman.
She looked suddenly bowed and broken, and, for
the first time in her life, old.</p>

<p>Jessica dropped her wrist, and turned away, a
low exclamation of disgust dropping from her lips.</p>

<p>"I want to send for Meriaz!" she exclaimed,
contemptuously.</p>

<p>"He is&mdash;here," stammered Mrs. Chalmers, helplessly.</p>

<p>"Here!" exclaimed Jessica, turning quickly, her
interest returning.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"And you never told me?"</p>

<p>"I came to tell you now."</p>

<p>"And you beat about the bush in this whining<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
way? Heavens! I sometimes wonder how it is
that you can be my mother! Where is he?"</p>

<p>"At the Holland."</p>

<p>"Send for him. Let him be here in my room at
seven o'clock this evening."</p>

<p>"He&mdash;wants&mdash;money," faltered Mrs. Chalmers.</p>

<p>"Money? I thought to have to pay a higher
price for his services than that. Certainly he can
have money&mdash;Carlita's money," she added, maliciously.
"Give him all he wants, but have him
here at seven. I am going out to drive with your
ward. Look here! There'll be a game of poker
here tonight. It'll be a rattler, too, and don't you
forget it! I want you to have your wits about
you, and not go wool-gathering. Carlita will
play."</p>

<p>"Carlita!"</p>

<p>"You look as shocked as if I had told you I intended
to murder her. She must win. Win
heavily, you understand?"</p>

<p>"She has consented to play?"</p>

<p>"No; but I mean that she shall before the evening
is over. Take care that the supper afterward
is exceptionally nice, and make sure that there is
plenty of champagne."</p>

<p>"You mean that she shall drink that?"</p>

<p>"I do. I know her hot Southern temperament.
There will be no half measures with her when she
has once learned her lesson. A useless waste of
time might be fatal to my plans, and I do not propose
that there shall be a moment lost. I don't
want you to come down there tonight looking as
you do now. Clear up your lugubrious countenance,
get that black stripe out of your hair, and
come down as your old smiling self. If you fail
me, you know well enough that there will be another
added in my list for vengeance."</p>

<p>"Is it possible that you are human, Jessica?"</p>

<p>"And your daughter, my lady!" she added, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
a mocking bow. "Bah! One would think that
you were an angel! Don't forget that I know
your life. Posing is not becoming to you. You
are detaining me from my sweet friend. Au
revoir!"</p>

<p>Ten minutes later she was tucking the robes
around Carlita in the victoria with as much tenderness
as a loving sister could have shown, and
as they were driving through the park she carefully
broached the subject upon which she had
spoken to her mother.</p>

<p>"Look here, Miss Priscilla," she began, half
laughing, in her boyish, fascinating way, "the
time has come for you to get out of this Madonna
life you are leading. I am going to take the reins
in my hands. Do you know what I have done?"</p>

<p>"No! What?"</p>

<p>"I have made arrangements to have a great
blowout at the house tonight, and you are to be
the principal attraction."</p>

<p>"I?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Did it ever really come home to you with
great force, Carlita, that you are a wonderfully
beautiful girl?"</p>

<p>"Flatterer!"</p>

<p>"Not at all: it's the solemn truth. If you are
really serious in desiring to work out the end you
have in view about Olney, you must bring Leith
Pierrepont to terms as quickly as you can. There
is absolutely nothing that will do it like feeling
that you need a protector. In spite of the crime
that he has committed, he is really a great prude
himself, or poses as one, which is quite the same
thing. He will not like to have the woman whom
he wishes to make his wife playing poker, and it
will bring him around more quickly than anything.
Come, now; will you join us tonight?"</p>

<p>It never occurred to Carlita to look into the logic
of the speech. She was restless, nervous. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
wanted to do something that would help her to forget
for even such a short time, and Jessica's
victory was infinitely easier than she had any idea
it would be.</p>

<p>"Yes, I will join you," she answered, feverishly,
feeling a sudden elation in knowing that she would
be doing something to which he would object.
"But I don't know how to play."</p>

<p>"You know the cards?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes."</p>

<p>"Then that will be quite sufficient. You'll learn
the rules of poker in five minutes, and that is about
all of the game that two-thirds of the people know
who play it, particularly those who consider
themselves experts. I told mamma to have
a supper prepared. We'll have a lark, and don't
you forget it. We shall accomplish your object
sooner than you anticipated."</p>

<p>"How shall I thank you for your help?"</p>

<p>"Wait until it is done, and your object is attained,
then, perhaps, you may see a way. What
have you got to wear tonight? It must not be
black."</p>

<p>"I have a white gown."</p>

<p>"We can make that answer with flowers. Suppose
we drive to the florist's, and then on home, to
make sure that everything will be in readiness?"</p>

<p>"I am willing."</p>

<p>A gleam of color had sprung already to Carlita's
pale cheeks, in anticipation of the evening. She
had determined that the old reserve should be
thrown completely aside, and that she would be
the gayest of the gay. She was comforting her
shrinking, sickening soul by the reflection that it
was for Olney's sake&mdash;to discover Olney's murderer.</p>

<p>And so they returned to prepare for the evening,
both of them in a whirl of excitement, though for
far different reasons.</p>

<p>It seemed to Carlita that it was impossible that
so much could have been accomplished in the few
short hours that had been allotted to the florist;
and yet, when she descended to the drawing-room,
the mantels were banked with flowers and the
rooms were decorated as if some grand ball were
in progress.</p>

<p>Her gown had been rearranged by the deft
fingers of Jessica's own maid until it seemed impossible
that it could have been one of the last
year's fashioning. The bodice was décolleté and
over the back and across the shoulders a fall of
magnificent old lace had been arranged, falling
in jabots from the front of the shoulders. A soft
old piece of "the cloth of silver" was laid in cross
plaits over the front, after the fashion of an old
fichu, and fastened at the waist with superb diamond
buckles which had belonged to her paternal
grandmother. On the shoulders, fastening the
lace, were diamond butterflies, their wings raised
as if they had but alighted for the moment, and
were even then ready to wing their way again.
The broad, round belt was caught with a diamond
arrow in the back, while in the hair a beautiful
bow knot of the same gems caught the rolls of
blue-black hair together.</p>

<p>Her throat and arms were bare save for a row
of diamonds about the wrists.</p>

<p>It was really a picture of superb beauty that she
presented as she stood there in the door of that
artistically decorated apartment, and one that no
man could look upon unmoved.</p>

<p>There was a glitter in Jessica's eyes as she observed&mdash;a
glitter of malicious hatred&mdash;and for a
moment the small teeth closed upon the crimson
underlip.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span></p>

<p>"Curse her!" she muttered, in voiceless hatred&mdash;"curse
her! She shall rue the day that she robbed
me of Leith Pierrepont's love! There is nothing
so sweet in life as vengeance!"</p>

<p>But she went forward with a bewilderingly fascinating
smile upon her lips.</p>

<p>"Ah, chèrie, how lovely you are," she exclaimed,
clasping her arms in delight. "If I were a man, I
should commit any folly, any madness to win you.
I even think I might emulate the young Lochinvar
and steal you away bodily. I can almost find it in
my heart to forgive the man who would commit a
crime in order that he might possess you."</p>

<p>"Hush!" exclaimed Carlita, with a slight shiver.
"I never felt such a sneak in my life. My courage
almost fails me at times. Have I the right to do
evil that good may come?"</p>

<p>Jessica shrugged her shoulders slightly.</p>

<p>"You must be the judge of that," she answered,
lightly. "It is your lover who has been murdered,
not mine. It was the man who was to have been
your husband who lies out there, treacherously
lured to his death, given no chance for self-defense,
suffocated like a rat in a hole, not even given an
opportunity for escape. It was your&mdash;"</p>

<p>"For the love of Heaven, hush!" cried Carlita,
all her lovely color forsaking her. "You are right&mdash;you
are right. I should be a coward&mdash;worse
than that, an accomplice&mdash;did I fail to make him
pay the penalty of his crime."</p>

<p>"Take care. There is the bell."</p>

<p>She took Carlita by the arm and led her quickly
into the conservatory, in order that she might have
time to recover herself, speaking to her in the old,
soothing voice, knowing her power as well as did
the treacherous sirens of old.</p>

<p>An hour later there were two tables for poker
formed in the drawing-room. At one of them Jessica
and Carlita sat with Redfield Ash, Dudley<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
Maltby and Hugh Beresford. At the other there
were six persons.</p>

<p>"We are to teach Carlita tonight!" exclaimed
Jessica, gayly, to the men at their table. "I assure
you she will be an apt pupil, though it is her first
attempt. I spent a whole hour this evening giving
her points on the game. Don't be surprised if you
all lose your good ducats, for you well know the
luck of a beginner. How many cards, Carlita?"</p>

<p>"Two, please."</p>

<p>"Three of a kind already? I shall be very careful,
I assure you, how I go up against your hands.
There you are! Now, Dudley, open the ball and
make it lively."</p>

<p>"Not on a pair of deuces," he answered, with a
short laugh, throwing down his cards. "I'm afraid
Miss de Barryos has robbed the pack."</p>

<p>The betting was really very small, the limit being
one dollar, and no one with a hand worth
much except Carlita. The pot was finally awarded
to her without seeing her hand, and once more
the cards were dealt.</p>

<p>This time she called for one, and a groan went
around the table.</p>

<p>"What is it?" asked Jessica, laughing. "A flush
or a straight?"</p>

<p>But Carlita only smiled and held her cards closely.</p>

<p>There were some rather good ones against her
this time, and the betting became lively; but as
she raised the bet again and again one backed
down and then another, until she finally proved
herself the victor once more.</p>

<p>"Let me see what you had!" exclaimed Jessica.
"Just as a matter of fun, you understand, though
it's not in accord with the rules of the game. A
bob-tail flush, as I live, and full a hundred to the
good!"</p>

<p>There was a shout of laughter from the men at
the wisdom of their new opponent, and the capital<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
manner in which she had won their money, and as
the noise continued, the name of the new arrival
which the servant announced was drowned:</p>

<p>"Mr. Pierrepont!"</p>

<p>It gave him an opportunity to pause at the door.
For a moment he did not recognize Carlita in her
white gown, flashing as she was with diamonds,
the flush of excitement coloring her lovely cheeks
to the hue of the wild rose, and when he did an expression
of such pain darkened his eyes as must
have attracted the attention of every one who observed
him. But no one did except Jessica, and he
had had ample time to recover himself before the
laughter had subsided.</p>

<p>He went forward in the old debonair manner and
stood behind Carlita's chair.</p>

<p>"Who won a hundred with a bob-tail flush?" he
asked, carelessly.</p>

<p>"Carlita!" answered Jessica, putting out her
hand to welcome him. "And she did it with the
coolness of a man who had spent his life in the
business. I predict she will become one of the
best players in New York. Come and join us.
Here is a chair for you."</p>

<p>"Thanks, no," he answered, after a slight hesitation.
"I don't feel up to it tonight. I'll watch
you for a moment, and perhaps you'll let me play
something for you on the piano later. No, don't
urge me, Maltby. I really couldn't. Do you like
the game, Miss de Barryos?"</p>

<p>There was something almost wistful in the question,
but Carlita threw up her head with a sort of
defiance and answered in a tone that contained a
metallic ring:</p>

<p>"Very. It is fascinating. I really think I shall
never want to do anything else."</p>

<p>Leith sighed slightly.</p>

<p>He was silent, striving to account for the sudden
and mysterious change in her, and yet for some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
reason unfathomable he dared not ask her the
cause. He watched them for a few hands, and
then wandered to the piano, playing a few selections
in which there was so little heart that it
wearied him.</p>

<p>Once or twice he got up to go, but some invisible
power seemed to chain him to the place.
He could not leave.</p>

<p>It was not until eleven o'clock, when supper was
announced, that he got an opportunity of saying a
word alone to Carlita.</p>

<p>"And so you are trying to unlearn Puritanism,"
he said to her, with a little wistful smile upon his
lips that made him so singularly handsome. "Do
you think you will like the change from saint to
satyr?"</p>

<p>"I was never a saint, and there is no reason why
I should be a satyr," she answered, forcing herself
to smile in return. "Puritanism must be an awfully
trying thing to one's friends."</p>

<p>"Not to the friends who love you."</p>

<p>"Our friends never love us unless we are interesting
to them."</p>

<p>"Friends who love you because you entertain
and amuse them are not worth having. They desecrate
the name. And friends who would degrade
you are demons in disguise, who are tempting you
to eternal ruin, branding your soul with the crest
of Satan in order that you may make them laugh."</p>

<p>For a moment Carlita glanced up with a mocking
smile upon her lips. Ah, verily was this the
"devil quoting scripture." A murderer&mdash;the murderer
of her lover, prating to her of her soul!</p>

<p>"You ought to go into the Salvation Army," she
cried, compelling her tongue to speak lightly. "Are
you without sin that you are willing to cast a
stone?"</p>

<p>"God knows I am not; but is a future denied to
man because of a blackened past? Heaven knows<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
I would give all the years to come if I could
cleanse my soul of sin and stand before you and
my God for one brief hour a pure man."</p>

<p>A wild light gleamed in her eyes. She bent forward
away from him, not daring to look at him.
Her voice was scarcely more than a whisper, and
yet he heard the words:</p>

<p>"You have sinned so deeply, then?"</p>

<p>He paused, lifting the heavy hair from his white
brow, as if its weight oppressed him.</p>

<p>"Yes," he answered.</p>

<p>"How?" she panted.</p>

<p>Another pause, then slowly:</p>

<p>"I can not tell you now, but some day I will.
Some day when&mdash;"</p>

<p>"When what?" she whispered, breathlessly.</p>

<p>He leaned forward and whispered in her ear:</p>

<p>"When I know that you love me, even as I love
you!"</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XX" id="CHAPTER_XX">CHAPTER XX.</a></h2>


<p>Carlita's heart was beating so that Pierrepont's
words were almost drowned in the sound. It
seemed impossible for her to reply. She had grown
dizzy and blind suddenly, and it was with a relief
that was almost hysterical that she welcomed a
young man who interrupted the tete-a-tete.</p>

<p>She knew perfectly well that that was not what
Stolliker would have had her do, that she was losing
an opportunity that she might never be able to
regain; but she could not help that, and when one
of the men who had played at the other table bent
over her to inquire how she had enjoyed the game,
she looked into his face with an interest, an animation,
that caused Pierrepont to turn away with a
weary sigh.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span></p>

<p>The supper was of the best; but when she left
the table, it would have been impossible for Carlita
to have told one thing that had been served. It
seemed to her that she had passed the time in a
state of hypnotism, living, moving, acting while
her senses were governed by some other power
than her own.</p>

<p>And yet she jested with a blithe merriment that
brought again the old expression of cynicism to
Pierrepont's countenance. Jessica had reserved the
seat beside herself for him, and he slipped into it
when there was nothing else to do.</p>

<p>"Is not our little Puritan charming tonight?"
she asked, with an animated smile. "I never imagined
that Carlita could be so bewitching. I fancy
that half the men in the room are in love with her.
Did you ever see her so beautiful?"</p>

<p>"Never so beautiful," he answered, with affected
lightness; "but much more charming many times."</p>

<p>"You approve of the Puritan type, then?"</p>

<p>"I am the strongest believer in individuality,
and she has lost hers tonight. She is as out of
place as&mdash;as&mdash;you would be in the role of Priscilla."</p>

<p>"I am not quite sure whether you intend that as
a compliment or the reverse," returned Jessica,
laughing; "but analysis is such a stupid thing. At
all events she gives promise of being one of the
best poker players I have ever seen, and while that
may not be altogether a recommendation for a
woman to the clerical class, it certainly is to the
persons whom Carlita is liable to meet. But let us
talk about yourself. Do you know, I fancy you
are not looking well."</p>

<p>"It is all fancy, I assure you."</p>

<p>"No, it is not. You are pale, dark under the
eyes, and disturbed looking."</p>

<p>"Biliousness, I give you my word."</p>

<p>"No. I'm afraid you got a germ of some sort<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
of disease in Mexico. You have never been yourself
since you returned from there."</p>

<p>He was eating a deviled kidney, sandwiched between
two broiled mushrooms, but pushed it away
from him as she spoke. The faintest perceptible
frown gathered between his eyes.</p>

<p>"Imagination!" he answered, with a short laugh.</p>

<p>"You liked Mexico, then?"</p>

<p>"I loathe it!" he returned. "I wish to God I
could never hear the name mentioned again. I
wish to God I had never seen the place!"</p>

<p>There had been a lull in the conversation, and
the words, low as they were spoken, were heard
from one end of the table to the other. Carlita
glanced up. A ghastly whiteness overspread her
countenance. For a moment it seemed to Jessica
that she was going to faint, but young Beresford
handed her a glass of champagne which she
drained before taking it from her lips.</p>

<p>Jessica's small teeth set angrily.</p>

<p>"If she believes him to be guilty," she muttered,
mentally, "why does this new evidence of his guilt
upset her like this? Curse her! She thinks she
can deceive me; but she shall see&mdash;she shall see!"</p>

<p>But she only smiled above her wrath, and turned
again to Pierrepont.</p>

<p>"How you are changing from the indifferent,
nonchalant man you used to be, whom nothing
could arouse from the even tenor of his way. There
are absolutely traces of passion in your speech
nowadays."</p>

<p>He bestowed a smile upon her which sent the blood
tingling through her veins, and said in the old
drawling, indolent way:</p>

<p>"There have always been traces of passion in
my nature."</p>

<p>It was just such a speech as in the old days had
convinced her, without further declaration from
him, that he loved her; and as memory returned of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
those times, she was forced to bite her lip to keep
the angry, bitter tears from her eyes. She saw
now how little there had ever been in it, saw how
little he had ever really cared, and a fierce hatred of
him leaped to life in her breast, a hatred that was
all the more savage because its very essence and
flame was the wild, passionate love for him which
she had not the least power to control.</p>

<p>"What frauds you men are!" she exclaimed,
forcing herself to speak lightly, though her heart
still ached poignantly. "There is so little in your
words and so much in your manner of saying
them. No wonder you break our hearts, and then
still your conscience by making yourselves believe
that you were not in fault, that you had said nothing
by which your honors were compromised."</p>

<p>"Do you believe that hearts break?" asked
Leith, mockingly.</p>

<p>"Not the heart of the 'new woman,'" answered
Jessica, laughing. "She is too familiar with the
genus homo."</p>

<p>"The 'new woman' has no heart. She is all
brain."</p>

<p>"Then you acknowledge that woman has, until
recently, had a 'corner on heart,' so to speak, and
that man for all time has been without one, being
a creature simply of brain?"</p>

<p>"Did I say so?"</p>

<p>"Practically, as the 'new woman' is only taking
her place in the front walks as man's intellectual
companion."</p>

<p>"Perhaps you are right; I don't know. It seems
to me sometimes as if men, and women, too, would
be better off without hearts. It has caused more
sin than it ever prevented a thousand times, and
has created more misery than happiness a million
to one. For my own part, if I could dispense with
the very necessary organ, it would give me the
greatest relief possible."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span></p>

<p>"Does that mean that you are in love, Pierrepont?"
questioned Redfield Ash, with his mouth
rather too full of food to be altogether intelligible.</p>

<p>"Did there ever live a man worthy of the name
who was not in love?" returned Leith, gallantly.
"I love all women."</p>

<p>"For the sake of one?" asked young Beresford,
with a sentimental glance toward Carlita.</p>

<p>Before Leith could reply, Jessica was on her
feet.</p>

<p>"This is not a confessional!" she cried, lightly.
"Now, we are going to award you gentlemen just
thirty minutes for your wine and cigars. At the
end of that time we shall expect you promptly in
the drawing-room."</p>

<p>"It is too much!" exclaimed Beresford. "I for
one am willing to forego the cigar in this occasion."</p>

<p>Jessica hesitated a moment, then, with a half
glance at Carlita, exclaimed:</p>

<p>"If Miss de Barryos does not object, you may
have the men in the drawing-room. Does smoke
nauseate you, Carlita?"</p>

<p>Carlita laughed.</p>

<p>"I used to light my old friend the gardener's
pipe, and I am sure he never had a new one
oftener than once in five years."</p>

<p>The men followed at once, and Jessica paused
only long enough to give instructions to the butler.
When she reached the drawing-room, Carlita was
already seated at the piano.</p>

<p>Her voice was a trifle weaker, from lack of practice,
than it had been the last time Leith heard her
sing, but it was infinitely sweet, and was greeted
with a vociferous round of applause which neither
one nor two songs would still; and then, stepping
to the piano, Leith asked her if she would undertake
the duet from "Aïda," which she had sung
with him on one occasion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span></p>

<p>She hated him for the request, and yet nothing
under heaven could have caused her to decline.
There was almost defiance in her eyes as she arose
and yielded her place upon the stool to him.</p>

<p>It was a magnificent thing, sung with wonderful
depth of feeling and power of expression, and was
a vast surprise to those present. Carlita wondered
afterward how she had ever been able to complete
it, but she heard his words of praise above all the
rest, though they were fewer and spoken scarcely
above his breath.</p>

<p>"What an artiste you will make&mdash;what an artiste
you are! God! it is enough to make a Christian of
a man to listen to you. And how you have improved
since we sang that together the last time.
I wish you would let me sing with you often. It
is like being permitted a glimpse into paradise."</p>

<p>He had risen, and was standing with his back to
the piano, looking down at her. The others were
all around them; but suddenly they seemed to
separate, no one knew how or why. They had
heard no announcement of a new arrival, but as
they stepped apart they realized that Jessica was
standing there, her fingers touching the arm of a
dark-visaged man whose aspect certainly was not
pleasant.</p>

<p>There was a tremulous smile upon her lips, half
expectant, half triumphant. She seemed to have
forgotten them for the moment, but went forward
straight up to Leith, who was not looking toward
her, but down at Carlita.</p>

<p>"Mr. Pierrepont," she exclaimed, speaking rather
louder than usual, "I want to introduce you to a
gentleman from Mexico. Senor Meriaz, Mr. Pierrepont!"</p>

<p>Leith glanced up. There had been a flush upon
his cheeks, brought there by the pleasure of singing
with Carlita, but as his eyes rested upon the
man before him, his color vanished, and from brow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
to throat a ghastly pallor overspread his face, that
the least observant could not fail to marvel at.</p>

<p>He caught at the edge of the piano, then recovered
himself almost as suddenly as he had lost his
self-control.</p>

<p>But it was Meriaz who replied to the introduction,
Meriaz whose voice alone was heard.</p>

<p>"Senor Pierrepont and I have met before!"</p>

<p>Then deliberately the dark-browed Mexican, who
possessed not an element of refinement or gentlemanliness
in his entire make-up, turned his back
upon the elegant man of the world.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXI" id="CHAPTER_XXI">CHAPTER XXI.</a></h2>


<p>There was a sensation in the drawing-room over
which Mrs. Chalmers presided.</p>

<p>They were not looking at that lady, or they
might have seen her pallor under all the artificial
color of her complexion, and would certainly have
noticed the nervous interlacing of her long fingers
as they twined themselves about each other, and
the little gasping breath that came through her
parted lips.</p>

<p>Carlita alone seemed to retain her absolute composure.</p>

<p>Not a detail of the situation had escaped her, not
even the angry compression of Leith Pierrepont's
lips as Senor Meriaz turned his back and calmly
sauntered to the other side of the room.</p>

<p>Young Beresford laughed constrainedly, feeling
that something must be done to lighten the situation.</p>

<p>"'Pon my soul, Pierrepont," he said, in a stage
whisper, "if looks were poniards, you wouldn't
be alive at this moment. Evidently you didn't hit
it off with your friend from Mexico. What was it?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
One of your usual escapades with a beautiful senorita?
His daughter, perhaps?"</p>

<p>Leith had never come so near having a downright
affection for the light-headed individual in
his life.</p>

<p>"I never had the pleasure of an acquaintance
with Senorita Meriaz, though I have met her," he
said, nonchalantly; "but I am not fond of her
father."</p>

<p>"It seemed almost as if your dislike extended to
all things Mexican," said Carlita, lightly, marveling
at her own coolness.</p>

<p>"Not to all things," he exclaimed, gallantly. "I
believe you are partly Mexican."</p>

<p>"We must all adore angels," said Redfield Ash,
with a bow to Carlita, "whether they be Mexican,
Hindoo or heathen Chinee, and such you have
proven yourself tonight by the beauty of your exquisite
voice, Miss de Barryos. Won't you sing
for us again? or are you weary?"</p>

<p>Carlita could never tell what impulse moved her,
nor how she happened to yield to it, but she
looked up into Pierrepont's face wistfully, and
said, slowly:</p>

<p>"Will you accompany me? Your playing would
convert a linnet to a nightingale."</p>

<p>He smiled the pleasure he felt, and seated himself
at once; but his mind seemed preoccupied, for
while he played the notes of the selection she
placed before him, there was not the spirit&mdash;the exquisite
coloring that usually characterized his playing,
Carlita observed, watching with ceaseless intent.</p>

<p>Suddenly she seemed to have forgotten to hate
herself for the despicable part she was playing&mdash;to
have forgotten everything in the interest that surrounded
the central figures in her little drama. She
was like the detective who forgets he is a spy,
under the excitement of a human chase.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span></p>

<p>After the song was finished, there was another
call to the tables for the poker to begin again, but
neither Pierrepont nor Meriaz joined them. Leith
retained his seat at the piano for a time, then suddenly
rose.</p>

<p>The game was progressing hilariously. No one
seemed to observe the fact that he had left the
piano. Meriaz was seated a trifle back of Carlita,
watching her hand, and as she glanced up she saw
Pierrepont look at him. There was a slight uplifting
of the eyebrows and the faintest movement of
the head toward the door, and then he turned and
went out.</p>

<p>Five minutes afterward, Meriaz arose leisurely,
and after walking about the room quietly, looking
at statuary and dainty objects of virtu, he followed
in the direction Leith had indicated.</p>

<p>Apparently Jessica had been oblivious of the by-play,
but Carlita looked toward her imploringly.</p>

<p>"I wonder if you could excuse me for a very few
minutes?" she questioned, her excitement making
her voice low and strained.</p>

<p>"Why, certainly," answered Jessica, sweetly. "Is
the heat of the room too much for you?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I don't know; but I will not be long absent.
You can play without me?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes!" answered Jessica, laughing. "Perhaps
some of your luck will flow over to my side.
My chips are getting pitifully low."</p>

<p>She did not even glance up as Carlita left the
room; but there was a curious twitching at the
corners of her mouth when she saw Carlita leave
by the same door by which Leith and Meriaz had
made their exit.</p>

<p>Carlita did not pause to think. She was keeping
her oath to the dead. She did not remember that
what she was about to do was dishonorable, unwomanly.
She had sworn that she would put all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
consideration of self behind in this search for the
murderer of her lover, and she was doing it.</p>

<p>She was in time to see Meriaz walk calmly into
the library, through the open door of which she
had seen Leith, and then the door was closed upon
them.</p>

<p>She hurried swiftly through the hall and lifted a
portière at the back end, through which she passed
into the adjoining room, separated from the library
only by a Japanese portière. The light was out in
the room that screened her, and was burning brilliantly
in the room that contained them, so that
she could see and hear everything without fear of
being seen.</p>

<p>"What has brought you here?" she heard Leith
demand, indignantly, of the repulsive-looking Mexican
who stood before him.</p>

<p>It was rather a change from his shrinking and
the bold manner of the Mexican when they had
been presented in the drawing-room, and she listened
breathlessly for the answer.</p>

<p>"To see you!" returned Meriaz, his black, cunning
eyes fixed greedily upon Leith's face.</p>

<p>"What for?" demanded Leith, towering over the
short, bulky Mexican in his majestic rage.</p>

<p>"You know perfectly well," answered Meriaz,
with a hateful grin. "I've come to find out the
whole of the situation that made you so anxious
that none of the story of young Winthrop's death
should ever get to this section of the country."</p>

<p>"And you have found out?" questioned Leith,
proudly.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes! You know me well enough to know
that it doesn't take long to do that. You are in
love with Miss de Barryos, the fiancé of the murdered
man."</p>

<p>"May I ask who gave you this information?"</p>

<p>"It was not necessary that any one should. I'm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
not blind. But, anyway, you know how perfectly
you are in my power."</p>

<p>"In what?" cried Leith, forgetting himself for a
moment, and thundering the word out so that
Meriaz lifted his hand warningly.</p>

<p>"There is no use in your giving the snap away
until that becomes necessary," he said, with despicable
cunning. "I am not going to peach, provided
you make it to my interest to keep quiet."</p>

<p>"What the devil do you want?"</p>

<p>"Money."</p>

<p>Leith hesitated. Even under his mustache both
Carlita and Meriaz saw how his lips were twitching,
how white they had grown.</p>

<p>"Pouf!" exclaimed the Mexican. "Why do you
hesitate? You got all of his money, and you can
surely give up that for protection."</p>

<p>Carlita half expected to see Pierrepont throttle
the wretch before him, but instead he turned away
and sat down before the writing-desk, leaning his
elbow upon it and shading his eyes with a hand
which trembled.</p>

<p>"I suppose you are right," he said, dully, after a
long pause. "How much do you want?"</p>

<p>"Five thousand&mdash;now."</p>

<p>"And when you have got it, do you promise to
take yourself back to Mexico or any place out of
my sight? Do you promise that this cursed business
shall be buried between us?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I promise; but you will leave me your address
so that I can write to you occasionally."</p>

<p>"You know the address well enough without my
giving it to you. There is one thing more. Will
you answer a question?"</p>

<p>"If I can."</p>

<p>"How did you happen to know Miss Chalmers?"</p>

<p>A curious expression crossed the face of the wily
Mexican.</p>

<p>"I knew her when she was a child," he answered,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
evasively. "I knew her father. It was
quite natural that I should come to call when I
came to America."</p>

<p>"But not natural that she should bring you into
her drawing-room to introduce you to her friends,"
returned Leith, forgetting that he was not very
complimentary. "Have you told her anything of
this story?"</p>

<p>"Not a thing."</p>

<p>"You swear it?"</p>

<p>"I swear it!"</p>

<p>There was another short pause, then Leith threw
out his hand deprecatingly.</p>

<p>"All right," he exclaimed. "There is my card
with my address. Come there tomorrow at twelve
and I will give you the five thousand. And now,
go back to the drawing-room and I will follow you
as quickly as possible so as not to attract attention."</p>

<p>The Mexican left the room without another
word, and feeling old and stiff, Carlita crept away
from her position beside the door.</p>

<p>She had seen Leith's head bowed upon his arms
which rested upon the desk, and somehow there
was a great lump in her throat which she felt
would burst into hysterical sobbing if she stood
there watching him.</p>

<p>The last doubt was gone now, but there was no
triumph in the convincing proof of his guilt.</p>

<p>She went out upon a little side balcony and
stood there with the cold night air blowing upon
her heated face. She never knew how long she
stayed there, but she was aroused at last by a mild
flood of tears that came pouring uncontrollably
from her eyes and hearing her own voice in her
ears sounding strange and eerie to her strained
senses:</p>

<p>"My God&mdash;my God! if it were only I who had
died&mdash;if it were only I!"</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXII" id="CHAPTER_XXII">CHAPTER XXII.</a></h2>


<p>It was a marvel to Carlita ever afterward how
she had the strength to drag through the apparently
endless hours of that evening, and yet after
that outburst of passion there alone under the pitiless
stars, she was to all appearances calm as a
stoic.</p>

<p>She said good-night to Pierrepont as smilingly
as to the others, and even permitted him to clasp
her cold fingers for a moment as he took his leave.</p>

<p>"Do tell me everything!" exclaimed Jessica,
when they were alone. "I have been feverishly
anxious for them to go for two hours, because I
knew there was so much that we should wish to
talk about."</p>

<p>But she only shook her head and pressed the
hand of her Judas wistfully.</p>

<p>"Not tonight," she answered, barely able to
keep the sobs out of her voice. "I am nervous and
tired. Tomorrow. Wait. You shall know everything
then, and you will help me to decide what I
am to do."</p>

<p>And Jessica, who knew all that would be told to
her on the morrow as well then as she ever could
know, put aside her curiosity gracefully.</p>

<p>"Of course, you poor, little tired child!" she exclaimed,
soothingly. "I should have had more
care for you and have put them out long ago.
Come to your room and let me be your maid. I'm
going to give you a nice soothing bromide, and tomorrow
you will be as good as new."</p>

<p>She would listen to no denial, but dismissed
Ahbel, and did not leave her charge until she was
well tucked up in bed with the bromide swallowed,
then she turned out the light and left the room
softly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span></p>

<p>Once outside the door, she paused and looked
back with a sneering smile.</p>

<p>"You poor little fool!" she muttered. "You
poor little fool! I know you already a thousand
times better than you know yourself. I could tell
you things about the state of your own heart that
would surprise you, I fancy. At all events, it is
something which you must not suspect until my
plot has been worked to the end. Upon my word,
matters are shaping themselves to my will better
even than if I had planned the circumstances of it
all."</p>

<p>But whatever may have been her intention in
the matter, her bromide worked to a charm, and
the following morning Carlita arose refreshed from
a profound sleep. Her cold plunge quite restored
her, and she descended to the breakfast-room as
bright and beautiful as if nothing had ever marred
the serenity of her young life.</p>

<p>After breakfast she and Jessica talked long and
earnestly in the privacy of the boudoir, a conversation
in which she detailed to Jessica what she
had purposely overheard the evening before, and
then they conferred upon what course had best
be pursued for the carrying out of their plan.</p>

<p>"You see!" exclaimed Jessica, when she had
been appealed to for advice, "the conversation
which you overheard has proven to you that this
man Meriaz can be bought. Now, the question is,
are you willing to give more for this information
than Pierrepont is for his silence?"</p>

<p>"I would give my fortune to the last farthing!"
cried Carlita, excitedly.</p>

<p>"Well, don't be foolish and give that away to
Meriaz, or he would be just hog enough to demand
it. My own opinion is that he has come down
rather light on Pierrepont, and when he has pocketed
that five thousand, with no evidence in the
hands of Pierrepont that it has been given over,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
he may be willing to sell his story to you for
another five, if you drive your bargain hard, or ten
at the outside. It isn't a good plan to squander
money on a scoundrel like that when you can prevent
it. You say that his appointment with Pierrepont
is for twelve?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Then I will write asking him to be here at two.
It is eleven thirty now," looking at a little Dresden
clock upon the mantel-shelf. "If my opinion
is worth anything, I should say that you are very
nearly at the end of your dilemma, and I certainly
think you have gotten out of it very easily."</p>

<p>Carlita did not reply, but sighed wearily. There
was no elation in her success, on the contrary her
heart ached as it had not done when she had been
informed of Olney's death, and a mist stood before
her eyes as she sat beside the window that prevented
her seeing the objects in the street.</p>

<p>And yet she took the note when Jessica had completed
it, and sent it by her own maid to the address
upon the envelope.</p>

<p>It seemed to her that the hours would never pass
between twelve and two, and yet when the announcement
was made to her that Senor Meriaz
was awaiting her in the library, she could not go
down and face him. She loathed him with a passionate
repulsion, and her whole nature rebelled at
the interview that must follow, yet she nerved herself
to it, and was stately in her calmness as she
entered the room where he waited.</p>

<p>"You sent for me, senorita?" he said, bowing to
her with the innate politeness of even the lowest
Spaniard.</p>

<p>"Miss de Barryos," she corrected, calmly.</p>

<p>"Was I mistaken, or did Miss Chalmers tell me
that you also were Mexican?"</p>

<p>"My father was a Mexican, not I. I do not
know the country," answered the girl, who but a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
few short months ago had loved to hear tales of
travel there, and had spoken the liquid, musical
language with such delight. "I sent for you,
Senor Meriaz, upon a most unpleasant errand."</p>

<p>"I can imagine nothing unpleasant connected
with&mdash;Miss&mdash;de Barryos," he answered, watching
her shiver curiously.</p>

<p>She took no notice of his words, but continued,
even more coldly than before:</p>

<p>"By design, senor, I overheard the conversation
between you and Mr. Pierrepont in this room."</p>

<p>"By design, senorita?"</p>

<p>"Yes," she answered, haughtily. "I was a witness
of your presentation to him; I saw him
motion to you to follow him from the drawing-room,
and a moment afterward I followed also.
I was behind that portière there when your conversation
took place."</p>

<p>"Well, senorita?" he said, coolly.</p>

<p>"I must ask you once more not to call me that."</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon. Custom causes me to use
it unaware."</p>

<p>She inclined her head slightly, and continued:</p>

<p>"Senor Meriaz, you are aware, as you informed
Mr. Pierrepont in that conversation, that I was
the betrothed wife of Mr. Olney Winthrop, five
thousand dollars of whose money was paid you
today to conceal some secret concerning his death."</p>

<p>She paused, but Meriaz only bowed with profound
indifference.</p>

<p>"You must understand," she went on, when she
saw that he did not intend to assist her, "how
very much interested I am in discovering everything
connected with the death of my fiancé, and it
was to induce you to tell me this secret that I
asked Miss Chalmers to send for you today."</p>

<p>"What inducement do you offer, seno&mdash;Miss de
Barryos?"</p>

<p>She hesitated a moment, then said, slowly:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span></p>

<p>"What inducement do you require, Senor
Meriaz?"</p>

<p>"Well," he exclaimed, greedily, passing his
mottled tongue over his still more mottled lips,
"it is quite true that Mr. Pierrepont paid me the
five thousand today to preserve the secret; will
you double that amount if I break my word and
return his five thousand to him?"</p>

<p>"No. In the first place, the money did not belong
to him. It belonged to the man who has been
murdered, and whose murderer I intend to bring
to the gallows, as he would desire. As his affianced
wife, I tell you that you may keep the money, and
to it I will add another five thousand if you tell
me the story Leith Pierrepont wished concealed,
if you will tell me how Olney Winthrop came to
his death; but not a dollar will I add to that
amount."</p>

<p>For a moment Meriaz hesitated, then leaning
forward, with his beady eyes fixed upon her, he
exclaimed:</p>

<p>"I may trust you?"</p>

<p>"I give you Miss Chalmers as my reference,"
she answered, coldly.</p>

<p>He leaned further forward, placing his arms
upon his knees. He reminded her of some treacherous
animal about to spring upon his helpless
prey, and somehow she felt as she imagined she
would if she were alone in a forest, the victim
of some repulsive beast.</p>

<p>"You want to know how Olney Winthrop came
to his death," he said, speaking in a half-hoarse
whisper, whose effect he had counted, "and you
offer me five thousand dollars to tell you the
story Leith Pierrepont would have concealed?"</p>

<p>"I do."</p>

<p>"Very well; I consent. Listen: Olney Winthrop
was suffocated in a deserted mine. He was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
pushed down by some one with whom he was
walking along the lonely road."</p>

<p>She had risen slowly, her hands pressed upon
her breast, her eyes wild with terror.</p>

<p>"And the person with whom he was walking,"
she cried, heavily, pantingly, "was&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Leith Pierrepont," he answered, sullenly.</p>

<p>She uttered a little half-strangled cry.</p>

<p>"You are sure," she gasped; "sure?"</p>

<p>"I saw it all," he said, slowly. "I saw them
walking, saw them approach the mine, saw the
shove, heard the fall and the awful cry as Winthrop
reached the bottom. There was no possible
way to save him, and Pierrepont knew that when
he threw him to his death."</p>

<p>She stood there stonily, the quiet of death growing
upon her.</p>

<p>"Can you prove this?" she asked, dully.</p>

<p>"Every word," he returned, cunningly, "if you
offer sufficient&mdash;inducement. That was not included
in the bargain."</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIII" id="CHAPTER_XXIII">CHAPTER XXIII.</a></h2>


<p>Carlita stood there for some moments resembling
nothing so much as some magnificent statue,
her countenance just as stony, her face just as
colorless, her form just as rigid. If she felt anything
whatever&mdash;any emotion of horror, contempt,
or triumph&mdash;there was no evidence of it&mdash;not even
in the tones of her voice when she spoke at last.</p>

<p>"I have no objection to paying you for the proof
which I shall demand that you furnish," she said,
quietly; "but you must understand that it must be
convincing&mdash;it must mean conviction. Accomplish
this, and I will add ten thousand to the amount already
agreed upon; fail, and you receive nothing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
beyond payment for your secret. Is this satisfactory?"</p>

<p>She must have been unobserving, indeed, not to
have seen the greedy roll of his beady eyes, the
miserly clutching of his grimy fingers, as if he already
felt the beloved gold in his too affectionate
clasp.</p>

<p>And yet he bowed almost coldly, in his absolute
control over himself.</p>

<p>"I have no fear of failure, senorita. Get him
back to Mexico, and leave the rest to me," he said,
indifferently. "I shall not regret to see him suffer
for his crime, but a man must look to his own
interest first."</p>

<p>A slight shiver of repugnance and contempt
passed over her, but vanished quickly in the utter
apathy that seemed to possess her.</p>

<p>She interrupted him almost before he had completed
his sentence.</p>

<p>"Until after the&mdash;the trial, I shall expect your
time to be mine, your services constantly at my disposal.
I shall expect you to remain in New York
until I tell you to go to Mexico, and to give all information
that may be required."</p>

<p>"I understand that to be in the bargain,
senorita," he returned, formally. "You will not
find me shirking any of the responsibility I have
undertaken."</p>

<p>"Very well. Leave your address upon that table,
I shall send for you when I need you."</p>

<p>It seemed to her that it would have been impossible
for her to stand there watching him until he
had written it out and left the room. The very
sight of him nauseated her&mdash;oppressed her with
terrible loathing. She turned from him and left
the room with that stately dignity which was so
recently acquired a characteristic, and slowly
mounted the stairs to her room, feeling worn and
weary, as if some new and hideous affliction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
weighed upon her, instead of the accomplishment
of a cherished revenge.</p>

<p>She had scarcely deserted the library when,
through the portière through which she had listened
the evening before to the conversation between
Meriaz and Pierrepont, Jessica glided with the
grace of a shining serpent. She went straight up
to Meriaz and smiled into his face with as singular
a fascination as she had been wont to use upon
her victims in society.</p>

<p>"Well," she exclaimed, half caressingly, "you
have accomplished it?"</p>

<p>He laughed slightly&mdash;not a pleasant sound; but
she did not shrink from it in the least.</p>

<p>"You put a good job in my way, little one," he
said, familiarly. "Twenty thousand ain't picked
up every day in the week. It was a lucky stroke for
me the day I started for New York, but that walk
down by the old Donato Mine was a still luckier
one. It ain't safe for us to talk too much here,
for I have found that walls have ears just as often
as little pitchers, and this room is a particularly
good place for eavesdroppers. But there is one
thing I want you to do for me, little one."</p>

<p>"What is it?"</p>

<p>"I want about five minutes' conversation with
your mother."</p>

<p>"What about?"</p>

<p>He smiled.</p>

<p>"That is my secret&mdash;and hers," he answered.</p>

<p>"She has no secrets from me."</p>

<p>"Perhaps not, but I don't mix up my affairs in
that promiscuous way. She may tell you, afterward,
if she likes. Will you arrange it so that I
can see her?"</p>

<p>For just a moment Jessica hesitated, and then
said, quietly:</p>

<p>"Come with me; I'll take you to her boudoir."</p>

<p>And, knowing how her mother detested the man,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
knowing how she feared him, Jessica led him upstairs,
and without seeking permission, ushered
him into her mother's presence.</p>

<p>She did not wait to overhear that conversation,
but went at once to Carlita's room.</p>

<p>Carlita did not hear her knock, did not hear the
door open; but Jessica found her seated beside the
window, her head resting upon the back of her
chair, her eyes closed, her hands upon her lap,
every muscle seemed to be relaxed save those of
the hands, but these were so tightly compressed as
to give ample indication of the terrible mental
strain which had well-nigh exhausted her.</p>

<p>There was time for Jessica to observe her closely
before Carlita became aware of her presence, and
a smile of absolute hatred was changed quickly to
one of tenderest solicitude as the dark eyes suddenly
opened and rested upon her face.</p>

<p>She went forward quickly and knelt by Carlita's
side, clasping her waist with both arms.</p>

<p>"I thought you were sleeping," she said, gently,
telling her lie as sweetly as if it were unvarnished
truth.</p>

<p>"Sleeping!" returned Carlita with a little shiver,
her voice heavy and dry and expressionless. "Oh,
no! I don't feel as if I should ever sleep again."</p>

<p>"Then it is&mdash;true?"</p>

<p>"God! So cruelly true that it seems impossible!
Why is it that fact is so much more ghastly in its
horror than fiction?"</p>

<p>"He can prove it?" asked Jessica, allowing the
question to go unanswered for want of knowledge
to meet it.</p>

<p>"Yes," cried Carlita, with the first semblance of
passion in her tone. "Prove it the most dastardly
crime in all the annals of criminal records. Oh,
my God! that man could be so false, so craven a
coward!"</p>

<p>"But the act is not what you have to think of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
now," exclaimed Jessica, feverishly, "it is its
punishment. What are you going to do?"</p>

<p>"I have not thought. It seems to me that I am
incapable of thought."</p>

<p>"But there is no time to be lost. If he should
discover in any way that we suspect him, he would
make his escape, and your opportunity would be
forever lost. You must act at once."</p>

<p>"But how?" asked Carlita, hoarsely, her interest
at piteously low ebb.</p>

<p>"Telegraph to Stolliker that you have the proof."</p>

<p>"Will you write it out for me? I feel so incapable,
so helpless."</p>

<p>Jessica did not wait for any instructions, but
went at once to the desk and wrote rapidly:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Have every proof you seek of guilt of man we
suspect in my possession. Obtain extradition papers
at once, and return here without loss of time.
Let me hear when this is received."</p></blockquote>

<p>And then with only the assistance from Carlita
of setting down the numbers in an apathetic way
on a telegraph blank as she hunted them out,
Jessica prepared it for transmission.</p>

<p>She did not leave Carlita alone after that, but
tortured her with ways and means of completing
her revenge, until it seemed to the poor, unhappy
child that she should go mad under the sound of
the well-modulated, musical voice. And yet she
would not have been left alone for worlds. It
seemed to her that in solitude madness lay, while
longing for it with all her heart.</p>

<p>If you have ever suffered from some terrible
shock, you will perfectly understand such inconsistency.</p>

<p>It was almost twelve o'clock that night when
Stolliker's answer arrived, and even to send it then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
he had been forced to bribe the operator to open
the office.</p>

<p>Carlita's fingers trembled so that she could not
hold the volume to search out the meaning of the
figures, but once more Jessica came to her aid.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Send necessary affidavit at once. Even then
much money will be required. Shall be forced to
bring officer with me. Be sure suspect knows
nothing of your movements and keep him near you
as constantly as possible. If you lose sight of him,
everything will fail."</p></blockquote>

<p>And the reply was sent before either of the two
girls slept:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Call upon me for all money necessary, and
spare no expense. Will send affidavit tomorrow
morning. Your instructions shall be fully carried
out."</p></blockquote>

<p>And then Carlita found herself alone.</p>

<p>Where was the triumph over the murderer of her
betrothed husband? Where was the exultation in
bringing to justice so dastardly a criminal? Where
was the wild joy in the fulfillment of an oath to
the dead?</p>

<p>Was it expressed in the tight clasping of those
interlaced fingers? Was it displayed in that passionate
outburst of bitter, uncontrollable weeping?</p>

<p>God knows alone; for the heart of women is beyond
human understanding, but after hours of
groveling in the most exquisite anguish which she
had ever known or ever dreamed of, she arose and
crept into bed, turning out the light before she had
undressed, because she was ashamed to face herself,
ashamed to think of the bitterness of her
agony, and yet understanding it no more than a
child would have understood.</p>

<p>The next morning Carlita was feeling far from
well. Her head ached, and there were dark circles
under her eyes. She awoke with a sense of utter
weariness of living, of the absolute desolation of
life. There was a choking sob in her throat with
returning consciousness with taking up the thread
again and continuing in the old way that fate had
marked out for her.</p>

<p>She felt a pity for herself that was not in keeping
with her understanding of the situation, but she
was too utterly miserable to think of analyzing
sensations or emotions. She could fully appreciate
the mental condition of the man who seeks oblivion
at any cost to himself.</p>

<p>Before she had an opportunity to arise, Jessica
entered, and, in her sweet, insidious way, persuaded
Carlita that she was in reality ill, a thing which
Carlita was by no means loath to believe, and
with the tenderest solicitude soothed her into quiet,
promising that she herself would attend to the
affidavit which was necessary to forward to Stolliker,
and that no point should be missing and no
time lost.</p>

<p>And poor Carlita allowed herself to be made to
believe that she was quite satisfied with the arrangement,
and kissed Jessica gratefully that she
was willing to undertake so much for her.</p>

<p>She even turned her face from the light and tried
to go to sleep again when Jessica had gone upon
her mission, but the sleep of the last few hours
had been induced only through physical exhaustion.
A pair of dark-gray eyes were looking reproachfully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
into her own, and a deep, tender,
wistful voice kept repeating:</p>

<p>"I will tell you when I am sure that you love
me even as I love you."</p>

<p>And then she heard again all the tones of his
voice, all the sweet, pathetic music of that duet
from Aïda in the tomb, and gasping, half-hysterical
sobs arose in her throat again, and she hid her face
in the pillows for very shame as she had shut herself
in the darkness the night before.</p>

<p>It was two days after that before she left her
room.</p>

<p>Jessica brought her the affidavit before it was
sent upon its mission to Stolliker, and she read it
with a renewed sinking of the heart, but there was
not a word uttered to prevent its going. On the
contrary, she was feverishly anxious until it was
on its way, even asking Jessica's advice about
sending some one with it as messenger instead
of intrusting it to the mails.</p>

<p>And then, after those two days, Leith's card was
brought to her.</p>

<p>She shrank away from it, and a little cry of torture
arose to her lips, but she repressed it bravely
and arose, compressing her lips firmly.</p>

<p>"Can I be false to the dead as well as to the
oath I have sworn?" she muttered to herself. "It
is necessary that I should play this part through,
and I will do it! You may trust me to avenge
you, Olney, even if I die of self-loathing and contempt!"</p>

<p>"You are not well again!" Leith exclaimed,
placing a chair for her as she entered the room.
"You have been suffering."</p>

<p>"Only from neuralgia and sleeplessness," she
replied, forcing herself to smile. "Insomnia is an
old enemy of mine."</p>

<p>"And a most bitter foe," added Leith earnestly.
"You need change of air. You ought to take a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
little trip abroad. Why don't you ask Mrs. Chalmers
to take you? They talked of going a short
while ago."</p>

<p>"Perhaps I shall, later on, but not now. I am
really not ill; you must not think it."</p>

<p>"You have never been yourself since&mdash;since
Olney died. Do you know, I have been half afraid
sometimes that&mdash;that I remind you of him, because&mdash;well,
you know, because we were such good
friends, and because of&mdash;of some things I was
traitor enough to say to you. I can't keep silent
when I am near you, when I see you, and I have
no right to speak when you are in this distress&mdash;when
I know that you do not care for me, and
for that reason I have thought it better that I
should not see you for awhile. I have come to say
good-bye, Carlita."</p>

<p>He had not dared to look at her during the
speech lest his courage should fail him, but he
had stammered through it like a blind man groping
through an unknown world. He had not seen her
growing pallor, the expression of dismay, fear,
misery&mdash;what was it?&mdash;that darkened her eyes.
He only heard the quiver of her voice, that dear
voice whose every intonation was like a throb in
his own heart, when she repeated:</p>

<p>"Good-bye!"</p>

<p>Even then he would not look at her; dared not,
because of that weak courage, but answered
swiftly:</p>

<p>"Yes. It will only be for a time, until I can see
you and not blurt out the story of my love at
every breath, a story which could not but be hateful
to you. But you will let me come back then,
will you not? You will still let me be your
friend?"</p>

<p>She did not reply, she could not. Stolliker's
words were dancing before her excited vision in
letters of fire:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span></p>

<p>"If you lose sight of him, everything will fail."</p>

<p>Was she to keep her oath to her dead lover, or
was she to let this man escape? She knew but
too well that everything depended upon her.</p>

<p>For one moment her heart cried out madly:</p>

<p>"Why should you sacrifice everything that is womanly
and honest in your nature because of your
revenge?" And then she understood that she was
lying to herself, deceiving her own soul in order
to save herself from her own loathing.</p>

<p>And all that time he was standing there staring
through the window, thinking of what he was giving
up, of the loneliness of life when he should be
able to see her no longer, and of the necessity that
demanded it. He did not even hear her rise, did
not see the awful, strained pallor of her countenance
as she approached him, step by step, as if
each one were attached with the most ghastly
pain, but he did feel the touch of her fingers upon
his arm, did hear the sweet tones of her lovely
voice, hoarse and dulled as it was:</p>

<p>"It is necessary that you should go&mdash;until I&mdash;send
you?"</p>

<p>He turned and caught her in his arms, pressing
kiss after kiss upon her lips; but she beat him
back from her, crying out her awful torture wildly:</p>

<p>"Don't! Don't! For the love of God, don't
touch me! Can't you see what I am? Don't you
understand all the treachery of it? Doesn't something
tell you that I am taking advantage of your
love to lure you to ruin and death?"</p>

<p>"Carlita! Carlita, what are you saying?"</p>

<p>He had dropped his arms from about her and
staggered back, white to the lips.</p>

<p>The sound of her voice seemed to recall her as
suddenly as his kisses had driven her mad. She
pressed her icy hands over her mouth and groaned.</p>

<p>"I don't know," she moaned. "It is treachery
to Olney, I think. It is&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span></p>

<p>But he did not allow her to complete the self-accusation.</p>

<p>"Oh, it is only that!" he exclaimed, "he would
desire you to be happy. I know him so well, none
better. He was so generous, so noble; neither
living nor dead would he stand between you and
happiness. Listen to me, Carlita, and then if you
tell me to go, I will go, and if you tell me to
stay, I will stay, God knows how gladly. You are
alone in this world, pitifully alone. More alone
than if you were in the heart of the forest; for
even those by whom you are surrounded are not
your friends and are striving to ruin you. I could not
remain and witness it. I love you! Love you
with the whole strength of my heart and soul!
There is nothing I would not do to win you! I
know that only a short time has elapsed since the
death of your fiancé, but if he could speak, he
would tell me to do what I have done, to protect
you with my love, to save you from the ruin of
both soul and body that threatens you. Carlita is it
go, or stay?"</p>

<p>She hesitated only a moment, wondering in her
heart which she hated most, herself or him, and
then the word came in a gasping whisper:</p>

<p>"Stay!"</p>

<p>He caught her hand, but she shrank back in but
too evident torture.</p>

<p>"Not yet!" she cried, breathlessly. "Not yet!
It is too soon after&mdash;after his death. You would
not wish it&mdash;yet. Whatever I may feel&mdash;oh, surely
you understand! And yet&mdash;I can not&mdash;can not let
you&mdash;go!"</p>

<p>He actually smiled soothingly.</p>

<p>"And I shall not ask it until you yield it of your
own will. Heaven knows I never expected so
much, that I am the most undeserving yet the
most grateful wretch alive. You have made me
the happiest man under the sun, and though you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
have forbidden excess of expression, you will not
deny me the right of an accepted lover beyond
that. Carlita darling, look in my face and read, if
you can, the pure and holy joy you have given me."</p>

<p>She glanced at him for only a moment, then
passionately covered her eyes with her hands.</p>

<p>"It is almost as&mdash;he looked," she groaned.</p>

<p>He smiled again indulgently.</p>

<p>"Poor little hysterical girl," he murmured, tenderly,
without touching her, "you will overcome all
this in time, but it is enough for me now to know
that you love me. Heaven knows it is possession
enough for the best of men. You will let me tell
Mrs. Chalmers?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no, no, no!" she cried, huskily. "No one
at all&mdash;yet!"</p>

<p>"As you will about that," he returned, gently,
"but at least you must allow me to guide you in
some things. You must yield especially in one.
No more poker for my affianced wife. And you
are that, my darling; let the story be told or remain
a secret between us as you will, you are my
affianced wife."</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXV" id="CHAPTER_XXV">CHAPTER XXV.</a></h2>


<p>Carlita was trembling so that neither affirmation
nor protest was possible.</p>

<p>She would have run away, perhaps, and have
hidden herself for very shame, but that the ability
was denied her. She stared at him helplessly,
hopelessly, a wild insane longing to tell him everything
taking possession of her; but she shrank
from the desire even more than from the lie she
was enacting. She hated herself for wishing to be
false to her oath, more than for the despicable
treachery of her conduct.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span></p>

<p>It was a curious sensation, and intensified as she
found herself thinking how handsome he was, how
magnificent in his princely bearing, his grave face
lighted with a smile, so tender, so wistful, as to
transform his masculine beauty almost to pleading.</p>

<p>She suddenly forgot that he was a murderer,
after having that thought uppermost in her mind
for weeks, forgot that his hands had taken a life
in the most cowardly way that life ever had been
taken, and of her own accord she put out her icy
fingers and allowed him to clasp them in his warm
throbbing palm.</p>

<p>Jessica, through the door-way of the conservatory,
saw her, and an expression of fiendish malice
left her lips, so illy suppressed as to almost betray
her presence there; but both Carlita and Pierrepont
were too absorbed to hear.</p>

<p>Leith did not draw her to him&mdash;he was too much
a gentleman to offer an unwelcome caress&mdash;but
pressed the little cold hand tenderly.</p>

<p>"You promise, my darling?" he whispered, so
gently that Jessica ground her teeth in rage.</p>

<p>"Whatever happens," gasped Carlita, hoarsely,
"I will promise you that I will not play again, and
I will keep my word as sacredly as if the pledge
were made to God!"</p>

<p>The impassioned speech, filled with fierce suffering,
reached Jessica, and a cruel smile shot across
her mouth.</p>

<p>"Ah, surely, it is a complete revenge!" she muttered,
triumphantly. "What more can there be to
be desired? Fool&mdash;fool! even she does not realize
it all&mdash;yet!"</p>

<p>"I wish I could tell you how happy you have
made me," returned Leith; the quiet joy in his
beautiful voice thrilling through Carlita like some
sweet strain of exquisite music. "It is not exactly
the kind of betrothal which I had hoped for, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
I had prayed for, but I understand how you feel so
well, and I am so grateful. The absence from you
would have been harder to bear even than death
itself, but I would have borne it, rather than have
distressed you with my presence. You have saved
me that, love, and I think I appreciate the trust
you have shown in me a thousand times more even
than if you had opened your dear arms to receive
me. Would you prefer that I should keep silent
for the present, darling, and go on just as we were
before, apparently, save that I shall have the precious
knowledge of your love in my heart?"</p>

<p>"Yes, oh, yes," she moaned, covering her face
with her hands.</p>

<p>"Your will shall be my law," he answered. "But
you will not punish me if I forget occasionally and
say some word that you had rather would have remained
unspoken, will you, sweetheart?"</p>

<p>He could not hear the words that came in stifled
whispers through her fingers, but going closer to
her side, he passed his hand across her hair caressingly.</p>

<p>"There. You are distressed and upset," he murmured,
with infinite tenderness. "I will go now.
Tomorrow you will be more yourself, and we will
talk the matter over quite calmly together. I can
scarcely realize that the dream of my life is to be
a reality. I can scarcely credit the fact that this
great happiness is mine at last."</p>

<p>He paused and hesitated like a bashful boy, the
debonair man of the world grown timid in the presence
of this mastering passion, then said in a tone so
low that it scarcely reached her:</p>

<p>"Will you not say 'God keep you, Leith,' before
I go?"</p>

<p>She could scarcely control the cry that was
wrung from her heart. She could not lie with the
name of God upon her lips. She was doing evil<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
that good might come, but she could not go so
far as that.</p>

<p>She looked up at him with an anguish which he
could not comprehend. Her white lips trembled
piteously. Her hands were twisted about each
other in a manner which he had never seen before,
and for a moment he was frightened. And
then he found himself listening intently to her
mumbled words, almost inaudible, incoherent:</p>

<p>"Ask nothing of me today, Leith. I can not&mdash;say&mdash;Oh,
my God, have pity upon me, and go!"</p>

<p>She flung out her hands passionately, and he
caught them in his tenderly, and pressed his lips
upon them.</p>

<p>"Remember," he said, softly, "that my love is
as steadfast as the grave. There is no demand you
can make which it would not yield. Rest, my love,
and have a little pity upon yourself. Your sensitiveness,
your conscientiousness is too great, if
such God-given gifts can come in superabundance.
Little one, go pray to the Blessed Mother to help
you and to show you the right way in this trouble,
from which I am shut out."</p>

<p>He had been holding her hands in a close, warm
clasp, and as his voice ceased he lifted them again
and kissed them, without passion, but with the tenderness
of incalculable love, and then he passed
out, leaving her standing there like some crushed
autumn rose.</p>

<p>The accepted lover, the betrothed husband, worshiping
at the shrine that had apparently blessed
him with the greatest favor that he had ever
prayed for, went down the stoop with a sigh upon
his lips, instead of the smile of exultant joy, and
the girl who had promised herself in marriage
sank down upon the floor in the place where he
had stood, sobbing in that tearless way that echoes
through a broken heart.</p>

<p>It was a long time before Jessica could sufficiently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
control herself to venture to her side, but
when she did she put her arms about the shrinking
girl and lifted her as gently as a sister might
have done.</p>

<p>"What is it?" she questioned, as if she had not
been a witness of that scene. "What has happened
to upset you like this, dear one? Has&mdash;he
been here?"</p>

<p>"Oh, don't touch me!" gasped Carlita, struggling
to her feet. "I am the greatest sneak on all
God's earth, a greater criminal even than he! I
have prostituted the noblest of Heaven's sentiments.
I promised to be the wife of a murderer, allowed
him to kiss my hands&mdash;and all to lure him
to ruin and death&mdash;to ruin and death! Will not
God Himself turn from me in loathing for my
treachery? Have I the right to sin that punishment
may come to another? Has not He said,
'Vengeance is mine! I will repay?'"</p>

<p>It was with the greatest difficulty that Jessica
concealed her hatred and disgust. She stepped
back slightly and folded her arms curiously across
her breast.</p>

<p>"You should have thought of all that before you
began this&mdash;investigation," she said, calmly, "before
you swore the oath that bound you soul and
body to the dead. The laws of your country tell
you that murder is punishable with death."</p>

<p>"And yet Christ Himself repealed the old Mosaic
law of 'An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth.'"</p>

<p>"I am not going to argue with you on the religious
side of your position; I did not even know you
considered that at all when you bound yourself to
your vengeance of the dead. At all events, you
have gone too far now to withdraw from the stand
you have taken. The affidavit of an eye-witness
of his crime has gone on its mission to your own
detective. In a fortnight at most, he will be here<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
with the papers of extradition which you yourself
have ordered"&mdash;watching her victim shiver with a
delight that was fiendish. "You have even notified
him that no expense was to be spared in the
punishment of the criminal, and I don't see how
it will be possible for you to withdraw from the
position now."</p>

<p>"And you think it is right?" she groaned. "You
do not think that I have sinned beyond pardon?"</p>

<p>"I think you would sin beyond pardon if you
were to allow the murderer of your betrothed husband
to escape!" exclaimed Jessica, speaking the
words in a curious, sibilant way that gave them a
horribly discordant sound. "Do you know what
you would force the world to believe&mdash;for matters
have gone too far now for concealment from the
world?"</p>

<p>"No; what?"</p>

<p>"Remember, you compel me to do this. I would
spare you if I could."</p>

<p>"Go on!"</p>

<p>"You would force the world to believe that you
allowed the murderer of your affianced husband to
escape&mdash;because of a guilty passion&mdash;because you
had fallen in love with him."</p>

<p>Not a sound escaped Carlita. She drew herself
up, and a fierce pang like death shot through her
heart and eyes. Even then she did not realize the
full force of the awful truth that had been so
cruelly thrust before her.</p>

<p>She looked Jessica straight in the eye for one
moment, then said, stonily:</p>

<p>"It is enough! The world shall not say that,
for Olney's sake! I will see the ghastly play
through to the bitter end!"</p>

<p>Then she turned and walked out of the room as
steadily as if she had not been bent and broken
with grief less than ten minutes before.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span></p>

<p>Jessica watched her go, allowing her scornful
smile full play as she realized that she was alone.</p>

<p>"That shot told in more ways than one," she
said, sneeringly. "I think her suffering will be all
that even I could desire. Was ever vengeance so
perfect and complete as mine?"</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVI" id="CHAPTER_XXVI">CHAPTER XXVI.</a></h2>


<p>Carlita was sleeping fitfully.</p>

<p>The morning had broken brilliant and balmly, as
an indolent day in idle spring, with the usual inaccuracy
of our unstable climate. Through the
neglected slats of her shutters the sun crept in delicious
defiance, and after a time awakened her.
She arose and opened the shutters wide, then lay
back upon the bed, her arms stretched out like
those of an infant in his idle longing to clasp the
golden beam. She had forgotten the old ache in
her heart for the time, but life was suddenly recalled
to her by the gentle opening of her door and
the entrance of her maid.</p>

<p>"Good-morning, Ahbel," she exclaimed, lazily.
"Is the morning as glorious as it looks, or is poor
humanity deceived by the brilliancy of the sun?"</p>

<p>"It is like a perfect day in summer," answered
the maid; "it is even more beautiful than it looks.
Here is a letter for you. It is so early that I feared
to bring it lest I should disturb you; but the messenger
is waiting, and insisted that you should receive
it at once. There is also one for Miss Chalmers."</p>

<p>Carlita raised herself upon her pillow and took
it, an expression of interest in her dark eyes. She
broke the seal, and as the first words met her eye,
would have flung it from her but for the presence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
of her maid. As it was, she compressed her lips
angrily, and read it calmly:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Darling Carlita</span>: I arose with the lark this
morning, my breast too small a space for the confinement
of my great joy, and find the day so
superb that I have planned a little excursion in
which I know you will be interested. You have
never seen my yacht, the 'Eolus.' I have her now
at the yacht club pier at the foot of Twenty-sixth
Street&mdash;ordered out of winter quarters for the trip
I expected to take, but will not, thank Heaven!&mdash;where
she is rocking in the gentlest breeze of the
year, longing to welcome the presence of her sweet
mistress. Won't you come out for a little cruise?
It will be indescribably beautiful today. I have
written to Jessica, asking her and Mrs. Chalmers,
and shall find Redfield Ash or Dudley Maltby, and
perhaps Colonel Washburn for Mrs. Chalmers, if
you will only consent. Of course you can come
back any time that you may get tired of it, if you
are not a good sailor; but I assure you that the
day is too fine for danger from <i>mal de mer</i>, even
if you are the worst on record. Don't disappoint
me, darling. If you consent, I will send up for
you at ten-thirty, so that you can be at the pier
at eleven, sharp. It will be impossible for me to
come myself, as there will be considerable that
will require my attention. The bay is magnificent.
Anticipating a day of elysium,</p>

<p class="sig0">
"Yours faithfully unto death,</p>
<p class="sig1">"<span class="smcap">Leith.</span>"</p></blockquote>

<p>The very sight of the name distressed her, bringing
back all the horror and suffering, the very
mental exhaustion of the evening before. She
hated him still more that he had intruded upon her
forgetfulness, her happy oblivion of the moment,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
and sprang from the bed, intending to pen a hasty
refusal.</p>

<p>Her escritoire stood in the corner by the window,
and as she sat down, the sun streamed
through, touching her shoulder with a warmth that
was caressing.</p>

<p>She paused, with the pen poised in air, and
looked out.</p>

<p>How smilingly beautiful nature was!</p>

<p>She saw the bay, in imagination, smooth as a
mirror, scarcely a ripple marring its surface. There
were white sails dotted here and there fluttering in
the soft breeze. Further off was the brown, beaten
shore, in happy contrast with the indolent life
upon the water, and over all the golden sun
streaming down in unforbidden splendor.</p>

<p>The imaginative picture was too attractive to be
resisted.</p>

<p>As she sat there, still hesitating, Jessica came in
with her note open in her hand. She had flung a
negligee over her night-dress, and while her hair
was disheveled, the dancing light in her eyes made
her almost beautiful.</p>

<p>"Of course you'll go!" she exclaimed, breathlessly.
"Leith says that he has written to you. I
have already awakened mamma, and she is getting
dressed now. Won't it be delicious? I never saw
a finer day in March, and it would be simply sinful
not to take advantage of it."</p>

<p>"You think I ought to accept?" asked Carlita,
wistfully.</p>

<p>"Think? Great heavens! you hadn't thought of
declining?"</p>

<p>"Certainly."</p>

<p>"Then put such madness out of your head at
once. Leith Pierrepont has one of the nicest yachts
afloat. It isn't the largest, and it isn't the fleetest,
but I'll venture to say that none of them can surpass<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
her in luxuriousness. Write your note and accept
for all of us."</p>

<p>Carlita hesitated again.</p>

<p>"Oh, I can't!" she exclaimed. "I can't write it.
You do it, won't you, dear?"</p>

<p>"Of course, I shan't!" cried Jessica. "You must
do it yourself!"</p>

<p>Once more Carlita's eyes wandered out to the
sunlight, she who had lived under its scorching rays
for the greater part of her life, and loved it, then
she turned wearily to her desk and again dipped the
pen in ink.</p>

<p>What should she say to him? How begin a note
of acceptance to this man? She shivered, and then
became conscious that the ink had dried upon her
pen again. She thrust it back into the well, realizing
that thought would accomplish nothing, in this instance;
she must trust to inspiration.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"So charming an invitation could not be refused
on a day like this," she wrote, hastily. "I love the
sea. Expect us promptly at eleven. I accept for
Mrs. Chalmers and Jessica as well as myself. With
gratitude for the thought that suggested so delightful
an excursion,</p>

<p class="sig1">
<span class="smcap">Carlita.</span>"<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>She dispatched it to the messenger, and then the
details of costuming was begun, Jessica almost like
a child in the delight of anticipation.</p>

<p>And very <i>chic</i> they looked in their pretty gowns
as they stood upon the old pier below the Bellevue
Morgue, the breeze almost too light to even wave the
skirts of their dresses.</p>

<p>Dudley Maltby, Colonel Washburn and Leith were
waiting for them, with the pretty bright dory at the
foot of the stairs swaying gently on the water,
manned by two sailors in fresh, artistic costume.</p>

<p>"How good of you to come!" exclaimed Leith in
a low tone, as he pressed Carlita's hand. "I was so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
afraid you wouldn't, that it seemed to me the messenger
was gone a week. Come, let me put you in
the dory. Take care. That step is wet and may
be slippery. There is the 'Eolus' lying over there.
Doesn't she look proud of the trust I am putting in
her today by allowing her to carry so precious a
life?"</p>

<p>"She is very&mdash;handsome," stammered Carlita.</p>

<p>In spite of the brilliancy of the day, she was wishing
with all her heart that she had not come; but
as her eye caught sight of the yacht she sighed with
a pleasure which she would have been more than
human not to feel.</p>

<p>As Jessica had said, she was not so large as some,
but to a practiced eye would have appeared about
one hundred and seventy-five feet over all, a length
that precludes the possibility of cramped quarters for
a small party, so trimly built, so dainty and tasteful
a little craft, that the most unappreciative could have
regarded her with nothing but pleasure.</p>

<p>As Carlita ascended the lowered steps, carpeted
gayly in brilliant red Axminster, attended by her
careful knight, she saw the fittings of the luxurious
deck, great deep chairs, huge broad couches, upholstered
with a richness of material that seemed
extravagance even in a man of great wealth, with pillows
strewn about that were artistic enough to have
occupied a place in the most costly <i>boudoir</i>.</p>

<p>Nor were the saloon, sleeping apartments, drawing-room
and library behind in point of attraction,
and Carlita clasped her hands in delight as one suite,
of unusual beauty, was shown her.</p>

<p>"I am going to have this refitted for you," Leith
said, as he bent above her dark head caressingly.
"I have in my mind now just what the draperies
shall be, worthy of the goddess they will surround."</p>

<p>"It is already fit for a princess!" exclaimed Carlita,
forgetting all about the past and the future in
her present pleasure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span></p>

<p>"But not comparable to what it will be. I am so
glad you like it."</p>

<p>"The greatest of Sybarites must necessarily do so."</p>

<p>"Let us go on a long cruise in her for our wedding-trip,
will you? Or should you grow tired of so close
a companionship with me?"</p>

<p>The question broke the spell again.</p>

<p>Suddenly the atmosphere seemed to grow hot and
stifling to her. The smile upon her lips drew to a
worn line of suffering and care. She pressed her
hand upon her heart and answered faintly:</p>

<p>"Let us get into the air. It is close and&mdash;and oppressive.
Where are the others?"</p>

<p>He looked at her curiously, wistfully, just a trifle
reproachfully, then exclaimed contritely:</p>

<p>"What a selfish brute I am! Always forgetting
my promises in the light of my own desire. Forgive
me, won't you? I promise not to offend again today.
Come. The others have all seen the yacht and are on
deck. We will join them. You are quite sure that
you have forgiven me?"</p>

<p>She looked up at him with a little smile, but it
was very pitiful, so filled with misery that it cut him
to the heart. His fingers had wandered toward hers,
that rested lightly upon his arm, but they dropped at
his side, unable to touch her.</p>

<p>In silence they went up the companion-way and on
to the deck.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVII" id="CHAPTER_XXVII">CHAPTER XXVII.</a></h2>


<p>With as much majestic grandeur as a small craft
can exhibit, the "Eolus" steamed down the river and
out into the bay.</p>

<p>The water was not quite so smooth as Carlita had
pictured it, but rippled and danced in the sunlight, reflecting
the opal tints in blinding splendor. White<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
sails were dotted here and there over the inviting
surface, while along the gray, winter-worn shore the
golden rifts were piled up, lending a fictitious beauty
that was entrancing.</p>

<p>It would have been sufficient to fill an artist's soul
with rapture just to lie idly at full length on one of
those superb couches, living in the exquisite loveliness
of Dame Nature, and Carlita stood gazing about
her in a sort of rapt wonder, her eyes wandering
slowly from the superbly appointed deck&mdash;with Mrs.
Chalmers sitting over next the starboard rail, with
old Colonel Washburn bending over her in a cavalier
devotion, and Jessica to the port, with Dudley Maltby
sitting facing her&mdash;to the water, and on down the
bay out to where a white line of sand stretched alluringly,
sparkling like myriads of scintillating diamonds.</p>

<p>An absolute silence seemed to infold the scene,
broken only by the gentle caress of the water upon
the sides of the tiny ship&mdash;a silence that made it
all appear like that mythical experience of Ulysses
when he listened to the seductive voices of the sirens.
Carlita clasped her hands in breathless delight.</p>

<p>"I will be happy today," she murmured, a trifle
hysterically. "I will put all past and future away,
and be happy for this one little day as if there had
been no yesterday and would be no tomorrow. This
day shall encompass time, and I will feel the full joy
of living once!"</p>

<p>As if in answer to her, a voice spoke in her ear:</p>

<p>"Come and let me make you comfortable. See,
I have placed a couch for you where the sun will
shine upon you, but will not be in your eyes, and I
have brought some books to read to you. Will you
come?"</p>

<p>She turned at once and obeyed, half defying her
own sensitiveness in her efforts to yield to that determination
to be happy.</p>

<p>It was a broad, long couch, upholstered luxuriously<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
in a magnificent dark green that contrasted perfectly
with the tones of the sea. She threw herself
upon it, allowing her delight almost passionate play
in her features, and permitted Leith to pile pillows
under and about her in gorgeous profusion; then,
when she looked as comfortable as even he could desire,
he drew up to her side a very low chair and
took a volume out of his pocket.</p>

<p>"Are you fond of Tennyson?" he asked. "If you
have a favorite, name it. I believe most of them are
in the library."</p>

<p>"Is it Tennyson you have there?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"I know my favorite so well, let me hear yours.
Read me what you like."</p>

<p>She said it so sweetly, so tenderly that he flushed
with pleasure. It was so different from her manner
of late that it touched him. He might have
been still more impressed if he had been able to read
that passionate cry in her heart that kept repeating
itself over and over again:</p>

<p>"I will be happy for this one little day&mdash;I will be
happy."</p>

<p>At first she could scarcely hear the sound of his
voice for the cry in her own heart, but gradually it
ceased under the soothing influence of his tone, and
as if in answer to a prayer for mercy, the awful future
was shut out completely, pitifully hidden in the
idly passing present.</p>

<p>He turned the leaves of the book for a moment,
then came to that sweet old poem that has stirred
the heart of every lover of Tennyson with sympathy,
"Locksley Hall," and read it as only a man with a
voice like his can read. When he came to the last
line, he thought she was sleeping, she had grown so
quiet, so motionless; but after a moment of silence
she stirred slightly and said in a low, dreamy tone:</p>

<p>"Do you believe that&mdash;that which you read:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"'Can I think of her as dead, and love her for the love she bore?<br /></span>
<span class="i2">No; she never loved me truly. Love is love for evermore?'"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>He thought he saw the trend of her thoughts, and
answered, softly:</p>

<p>"Who can say? We are so often mistaken in the
language of our hearts. How should we know, when
we listen to it for the first time, whether the love
is that of admiration, of sympathy, of the loneliness
of our own souls, of the desire to be loved, or of
such love as that to which Tennyson refers? When
that love comes, Carlita, the 'love that is love for
evermore,' the least comprehensive of us will know,
will understand, though we may have erred on former
occasions."</p>

<p>She did not reply, but lay there silent, motionless,
her eyes almost closed, but looking out from under
the lids dreamily at the gently changing world, her
beautiful hand lying palm upward on one of the sofa
pillows like a rose-leaf that has turned toward the
sun.</p>

<p>If he had not loved her before, his artistic soul
would have loved her then for the very unconscious
grace, the poetical charm of her lovely person.</p>

<p>He feared that he had saddened her, and so turned
to something in lighter vein, his well-modulated voice
making music with the waves.</p>

<p>"What a poem life would be if all the days were
like to this," she said when he had finished.</p>

<p>"It would lose its charm through lack of contrast,"
he returned, smiling. "How glaring the sun would
grow if there were no shadow. How dull the water
would appear if there were no land beyond. How
oppressive the silence would become if the hum of
wider, broader, busier life were stilled forever. And,
over all, how palsied and colorless would the whole
world be if there were nothing beyond, nothing but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
the limited stretch of a few brief years, with no hope
of the marvelous universe to come, governed by the
supreme power of Perfect Love. We have learned
something beyond lotus-eating in this kindergarten in
which God has placed us, and we love the languid
hour of absolute repose, because we have been so
long in the schoolroom, learning the lessons which
He has set for us, lessons of bitterness and strife, as
well as those of contentment and love. Life without
contrast would be as dull, as inartistic, as cloying as
a picture of sunshine without a shadow, as a poem
without a strain of sadness."</p>

<p>Her eyes wandered toward him, seeing all the
earnestness of his countenance, all the absolute belief
in the future that his words implied. She turned
them away again, out over the water, but even there
she saw him reflected in her imagination, his yachting
cap pushed back, his face flushed, his eyes gravely
earnest, as handsome a picture of perfect manhood
as the hand of Divinity had ever painted.</p>

<p>Not long afterward they were summoned down to
luncheon, a merry meal enjoyed by all; but it was
with a sense of relief and rest that Carlita wandered
back to her couch again as soon as she could leave
the others.</p>

<p>The afternoon was waning. Already a hazy red
was beginning to glow in the western sky, that had
changed from gold to pink in opalescent splendor.
The wind was freshening with the dying sun, and the
caress of the waves licked higher upon the dainty
craft.</p>

<p>Leith went below and had wraps brought in profusion;
but about Carlita he placed them himself,
tucking them in carefully that she might not feel the
influence of the breeze.</p>

<p>"You will not care to get home too early?" he
asked, caressingly. "The moon will be superb, and
there will be no roughness to speak of. You will
remain a while?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span></p>

<p>"I wish it would never end," she returned,
dreamily.</p>

<p>He smiled with the delight of a lover, that slow,
sweet smile for which she had begun to watch with
pleasure.</p>

<p>"You don't know what happiness your words give
me when I remember that I have been your only
companion," he said softly. "How beautiful you
are as you lie there with that crimson glow just
touching you! You are a tropical plant, Carlita, and
should be grown in a tropical country. Warmth suits
you. The bewildering delight of flaming colors make
you like some superb bird of plumage. You will love
Italy with a sort of savage delight, I fancy. You
have never traveled?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"What a world of pleasure there is in store for
you, what almost rapture! Our own country, while
beautiful, has none of the mythological and historical
memories that make other countries a constant poem.
One gets so weary of the newness and glitter of it
all, just as we should have grown of that gorgeous
old sun but for this Heaven-sent gloom. There is a
greater element of romance in most of us than practical,
particularly we who are removed from the sordid
compulsion of living-getting. We want to fancy ourselves
once in awhile as knights of the olden time,
performing deeds of valor for our Helens of Troy.
See! The sun is going out. He has illuminated the
old brown shore to positive glory with his good-night
kiss. Do you remember the sweet old poem of Percy
Shelley?"</p>

<p>He leaned forward, with that beautiful smile in
his eyes, and repeated it in his musical voice:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"'The fountains mingle with the river,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">And the rivers with the ocean;<br /></span>

<span class="i2">Nothing in the world is single;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">All things, by a law divine,<br /></span>

<span class="i2">And the sunlight clasps the earth,<br /></span>

<span class="i2">What are all these kisses worth,<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>He was looking down at her still with the smile
in his eyes, the light of incalculable love, and she
was looking up at him, totally unconscious of the
expression upon her tremulous lips and in the depths
of her beautiful eyes, totally unconscious of the wistful
permission that expression contained.</p>

<p>And then suddenly&mdash;how, neither he nor she could
tell&mdash;as the laughter of the others below reached
them, he leaned forward and his lips were pressed
upon hers, gently, yet lingeringly, lovingly, and then
he lifted his head&mdash;unrepulsed!</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVIII" id="CHAPTER_XXVIII">CHAPTER XXVIII.</a></h2>


<p>And still Carlita did not move. She lay there
staring up at him, as if some intoxicant had got
into her veins, paralyzing motion and emotion. She
was not conscious of sensation, and yet she saw
the light of unutterable happiness in his eyes, and
understood it perfectly.</p>

<p>He put out his hand and clasped hers with reverent
devotion. His lips moved, and she heard him
whisper:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span></p>

<p>"Thank God! my darling, I know that you are
mine at last!"</p>

<p>His lips touched the pink palm as it lay upturned
in his, then, with a shiver of returning consciousness
she realized that the others were coming upon deck.</p>

<p>She rose swiftly, nervously.</p>

<p>"Let us go back at once&mdash;at once!" she exclaimed,
hoarsely. "I&mdash;I think I am&mdash;ill!"</p>

<p>But, for all the assurance of illness, she went
hastily toward the others and greeted them with almost
hysterical lightness.</p>

<p>Leith looked after her in some surprise, then an
indulgent smile flitted over his handsome mouth.</p>

<p>"Poor little girl!" he murmured. "She is trying
to be so loyal to Olney, and Heaven knows I admire
her for it! Perhaps I should be less generous if I
were not so sure that she never loved him. God
bless her, my beautiful one!"</p>

<p>He went below and gave the order to the captain,
then returned to his guests on deck.</p>

<p>The wind had grown very fresh, with the usual
variableness of late March, and they soon found it
necessary to go below; but, even there the greater
part of their pleasure was over, for the yacht was
pitching considerably as the force of the wind and
waves increased.</p>

<p>Leith observed that Carlita was nervous almost
to the border of hysteria; and to cover her condition
from the others, he sat down to the piano and tried
to play; but the effort met with no great degree of
success, and he turned upon the stool and monopolized
the conversation for a time.</p>

<p>He observed, too, that a sort of constrained silence
had fallen upon Dudley Maltby, and that he looked
toward Jessica with a curious expression, which
faltered and fell as her eyes were cast in his
direction.</p>

<p>"Halloo!" muttered Leith, below his breath. "Has
that poor little devil been getting his wings singed?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
I wonder what the little Chalmers is up to now?
Poor Dud! He is really too good a fellow to get
under that domination. I wish to the Lord I had
not asked him."</p>

<p>And then before his soliloquy was ended, he heard
young Maltby say to her softly:</p>

<p>"Come into the library. There is a book I want
to show you."</p>

<p>The look she cast upon him was not lost upon
Leith.</p>

<p>"Good heavens!" he muttered. "What has the
poor chap done? She's not in love with him, that's
certain, but that she has got it in for him for some
reason is equally certain."</p>

<p>But he could not follow, even if he had so desired,
as Mrs. Chalmers was addressing some questions to
him; but he saw Jessica stagger against her young
cavalier as the yacht lurched, saw him place his arm
about her, and then&mdash;they disappeared.</p>

<p>Had he been able to penetrate behind that portière,
he might have seen the wretched boy holding her
hands in an impassioned clasp, his eyes strained and
blood-shot as he gazed into her smiling ones.</p>

<p>"It is utter folly, utter madness," he was saying.
"I can't give you up. I tell you I love you. Pouf!
How empty the word sounds. I feel like a man
drunk with opium in your presence. Jessica, you
must be my wife!"</p>

<p>She smiled daintily, charmingly.</p>

<p>"Your wife!" she exclaimed, lightly. "You can't
mean that, when you once said that it was as much
as a man's reputation was worth to be seen in my
box at the opera."</p>

<p>He dropped her hands and flushed crimson.</p>

<p>"How do you know that I did?" he inquired doggedly;
then, as he realized that he had practically
acknowledged the truth of her statement, he cried
passionately: "I was the greatest cad under heaven,
and I am willing to give the lie to my words by making<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
you my wife in face of all the world. Jessica,
I love you! Will you not listen to me?"</p>

<p>"Even if I were willing to forgive you, think of
the folly of it all," she said, laughing at his earnestness.
"You know the terms of your father's will.
You would have less than ten thousand a year if I
became your wife."</p>

<p>The poor imbecile did not pause to inquire how
she had found that out but cried eagerly:</p>

<p>"But surely that would be enough. It would not
be what we have been accustomed to, but with love
at the helm, surely we could steer our little craft!"</p>

<p>She laughed aloud lightly, but still not without a
certain fascination.</p>

<p>"Oh, Dudley!" she exclaimed, "you are not a
nineteenth-century boy at all. You belong to mediæval
times, and have been born at least a hundred
years too late. Come and let us go back to the
others. This yacht is pitching dreadfully. We have
quite a sea on, and I am not the best sailor that ever
lived, by any means. Oh, I say, come off! You
are a magnificent Knight of the Doleful Countenance.
Do you want to give away to all those people
the nonsense you have been saying to me? Now
smile and look happy, like a good boy. Just try to
imagine that I have made you every promise you can
possibly desire. Who knows but that I may, some
day?"</p>

<p>He took heart from her chaff and returned with
her to the others, because he felt that he could persuade
her to remain no longer.</p>

<p>Leith, Colonel Washburn and Mrs. Chalmers were
carrying on a heated discussion, while Carlita sat
apart at a table looking listlessly through a book of
engravings, not a subject of which could she have
told a moment later.</p>

<p>"Do you think we are going down?" asked Jessica,
lightly, as she joined them. "It would be too disastrous
a termination to our charming day."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span></p>

<p>"Not much danger, I fancy," replied Leith;
"though it has grown too rough to be pleasant. It
is rather tempting the fates to venture out at this
season."</p>

<p>"Oh, but how perfect the day has been!"</p>

<p>"But for the wind, the evening would have been
more so. We shall not be late getting in, however.
The captain assures me we shall be at the pier by
nine o'clock."</p>

<p>"It will be rather dangerous landing in the dory,
won't it?" asked Colonel Washburn, who was old
enough to think of his personal comfort above all
else.</p>

<p>"The tide will be high enough for us to go up to
the pier," replied Leith. "We are due there just
about the change."</p>

<p>"That's luck," somebody murmured.</p>

<p>But it seemed to Carlita that the time would never
pass. The day had been so short, so piteously
short, and those hours of the evening so endless!
It seemed to her that she would have given all the
world for five minutes alone, and yet she dared not
leave them, knowing that Leith would follow her.</p>

<p>Even yet she had not confessed to herself the awful
secret that was harrowing her soul, and there
before them all she dared not think.</p>

<p>It seemed to her that the happiest moment of her
life was when some one announced the fact that
they had arrived at the pier, and Leith came to conduct
her on shore.</p>

<p>But for the wind, the night would have been magnificent.
The moon was full, the cold, white rays
glinting over the waves in soft, almost phantom
beauty.</p>

<p>Out in the stream were numbers of vessels buffeting
the wind and tide, which was at rapid ebb, and
on either side the twin cities lay, their lights twinkling
like millions of brilliant stars.</p>

<p>Leith stepped upon the pier and lifted Carlita beside<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
him. Then, as the others would have followed,
the shrill scream of a childish voice reached them,
swept by the wind from the end of the pier, a cry
that sounded like the death-call of some wild bird
of the forest:</p>

<p>"Papa! papa! I've waited almost an hour, and
mamma is dying! They sent&mdash;"</p>

<p>But the end of the sentence was never reached.
There was a splash, and then:</p>

<p>"Good God!" exclaimed a man upon the end of
the pier. "He's fallen over."</p>

<p>Quicker than thought both Leith and Carlita had
dashed forward just in time to see the tiny dark
form swept out by the cruel tide, his little head just
visible above the crest of the wave.</p>

<p>Singularly enough, none of the men upon the
yacht seemed to have heard the scream, and not a
hand was extended toward the boats.</p>

<p>And yet there was not an instant to lose.</p>

<p>"The boat; quick, captain!" Leith shouted hoarsely.
"A child overboard!"</p>

<p>But the wind seemed to sweep the voice away
down the stream instead of toward the lurching
craft.</p>

<p>The small head was nothing but a speck now in
the moonlight, and then it disappeared altogether.</p>

<p>Before any one could realize it, there was another
splash, and Carlita knew the next moment that
Leith's coat and vest were lying at her feet, that
Leith himself had already gone in pursuit of that
drowning child; and then a woman's shriek rose
wild and clear upon the night air.</p>

<p>She bent forward eagerly, and distinctly heard
the man next her exclaim:</p>

<p>"Take care, lady, or you'll be over next!"</p>

<p>But what cared she?</p>

<p>She was watching the dark head in the moonlight,
watching the progress he was making, saw
the small speck beyond as it arose again to the surface,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
and then&mdash;who can compute time in instants
like that&mdash;she knew that Leith had seized the
child!</p>

<p>Already he had turned again, and was coming
toward the pier, but wind and tide were too strong
against him.</p>

<p>An agony of wild, intolerable fear arose in her
heart. She knew nothing of what was going on
around her, further than the knowledge that centered
in the danger of those two, and that, she realized
with a horrible anguish that was past all understanding.</p>

<p>She saw him struggling, struggling, saw the white
face lifted in the moonlight as if beseeching assistance;
and once more her voice rang out clear as a
liquid bell under her ghastly fear:</p>

<p>"A thousand dollars&mdash;five thousand dollars to the
man that saves his life!"</p>

<p>But already the boat was launched, and, as her
last words fell upon their ears, it shot out from under
the end of the pier and made straight toward the
hapless pair.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIX" id="CHAPTER_XXIX">CHAPTER XXIX.</a></h2>


<p>It was the work of moments after that.</p>

<p>There were strong, willing hands at the oars, and
the tiny boat leaped the waves like a bird on its
errand of mercy.</p>

<p>But even when Carlita had seen them drag Pierrepont,
with his tiny burden, into the boat safely, even
when she saw it approaching her again, valiantly
struggling against the swiftly ebbing tide, she could
not remove her strained, haggard eyes from it, could
not loosen the clutch of her rigid fingers from the
bosom of her gown just above her heart.</p>

<p>She did not seem to realize that he was safe until<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
he stood upon the pier beside her in the moonlight,
dripping wet, yet smiling happily while he deposited
the half drowned child into the arms of his father,
who had grown as hysterical as a woman, and turned
to her.</p>

<p>She was looking up into his face, her own cold
and gray as if frost had touched her very soul, and
there was something in it that frightened him.</p>

<p>He forgot how wet he was, and before all those
people he threw his arm around her and drew her
to him.</p>

<p>"Carlita, darling!" he exclaimed, anxiously. "Are
you frightened? See! We will neither of us be the
worse for a little wetting."</p>

<p>"Thank God, you are safe!" she cried, and then&mdash;her
face was hidden against something wet, and
her tears flowed.</p>

<p>When she recovered her composure sufficiently to
know what was going on about her, she heard something
of how it all had happened.</p>

<p>The child was the crippled son of the chef on
board the "Eolus." His mother had been ill for days,
and was taken rapidly worse toward nightfall; so
bad, in fact, that when the doctor was summoned
he gave no hope beyond the hour.</p>

<p>Knowing where the anxious husband was, a neighbor
had sent the boy to the pier to await the return
of the "Eolus," in order that there might be no delay
in his arrival; but the minutes passed, and as
the boy grew more anxious and tearful, his hysterical
unrest increased, so that when the "Eolus" really
did arrive, he could control himself no longer, and
the accident resulted through his too anxious desire
to reach his father quickly.</p>

<p>"You should have told me your wife was ill,"
Leith said to the man, kindly. "Pleasure is not so
essential that we can purchase it at such a cost to
others."</p>

<p>"I feared to lose my place, sir," the chef answered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
sadly. "And they are not so easy to obtain. I
could not afford it."</p>

<p>"Have I been so stern a master?"</p>

<p>"The best and kindest, sir. What gentleman but
you would have risked his life, as you have done,
to save a servant's crippled boy? I owe you his
life, and I shall not forget it!"</p>

<p>"Nonsense! Some one else would have saved him
if I had not. You'd better get the poor little
fellow home as quickly as you can. I fancy he has
a very uncomfortable load of salt water."</p>

<p>"He's got rid of most of it, I think, sir."</p>

<p>"But there is cold to avoid. Take one of the
rugs and wrap him up well. I hope you'll find it
better with your wife than you anticipate."</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir."</p>

<p>And then Leith remembered himself, and slipped
into his coat and overcoat, wrapping it about him
snugly.</p>

<p>"Ugh! This wind doesn't make the water warmer,"
he exclaimed, lightly. "Ladies, I regret that my condition
won't allow me to drive you home; but I'm
sure Maltby will take my place. Old fellow, I'm
trusting you with a very precious burden. Miss de
Barryos has promised to be my wife."</p>

<p>"I congratulate you with all my heart!" exclaimed
Maltby, shaking his hand heartily. "I thought I
had discovered a secret when I heard her offer five
thousand dollars to the man who would save your
life."</p>

<p>"You did that, Carlita?"</p>

<p>But her choking reply, if there was one, was
drowned in the sound of congratulations that followed.</p>

<p>"It was absolutely necessary that I should tell him
that," Leith explained to her as they walked down
the pier together, he still leaving a trail of water behind
him. "I kissed you before them all, and held<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
you in my arms, you know. You are not angry,
darling?"</p>

<p>She did not reply, only looked at him, but he
seemed to be satisfied with the look, for he smiled
with that ecstatic sort of grin that comes only to
the happy lover's countenance.</p>

<p>It was a silent drive homeward. Even Jessica
leaned in her own corner of the carriage, oblivious
of Maltby's remarks, until he, too, ceased to make
an effort at conversation. Mrs. Chalmers' face was
so white and drawn that it reminded him of the return
home from a funeral, and he was glad when the
carriage stopped before their door and he had said
good-night.</p>

<p>The day had ended disastrously for all except poor
Leith, who was living in the Fool's Paradise, and
the three women entered the house, going at once upstairs
without exchanging a word.</p>

<p>At Carlita's door Jessica paused, but the unhappy
girl exclaimed pleadingly:</p>

<p>"Not tonight, dear. I feel as if I should go mad
to face any one tonight, even my own conscience."</p>

<p>"As you will," Jessica murmured calmly.</p>

<p>She stood there until the door had closed, shutting
Carlita in, and then a cold, scornful, half-triumphant
laugh escaped her.</p>

<p>Her mother caught her arm in a grasp like iron.</p>

<p>"For God's sake, come away!" she gasped. "What
is this thing that you have done? What is this vengeance
that you are planning?"</p>

<p>"That I have almost accomplished," corrected
Jessica, looking into her face with a fiendish sort of
chuckle. "Never mind. I shall not tell you. With
your white-livered cowardice you might ruin it at
the last moment, and it shall not fail. Oh, go away,
with your eternal whining! Do you think that I
will forgive her for winning his heart away from
me? Do you think I will forgive him for playing
fast and loose? I hate them both as fiercely as you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
know I can hate, and they shall feel the fang of it
to the last day of both their lives!"</p>

<p>Carlita's maid followed her to her apartment almost
at once, and placed in her hand one of those
little yellow envelopes that turned her faint and sick
even before she had broken the seal.</p>

<p>"You may go, Ahbel," she exclaimed, wearily. "I
shall not need you this evening."</p>

<p>"But the back of your jacket is quite wet, Miss
de Barryos. At least you will let me remove that."</p>

<p>Carlita allowed herself to be divested of it rather
than speak, then watched her maid with wistful longing
as she left the room. When she was alone she
looked at the telegram in her hand, hesitated, even
put her fingers to the seal, then flung it upon the
table, far from her.</p>

<p>"I can't&mdash;tonight," she gasped. "I am so tired&mdash;so
tired that I can not look out the numbers. They
would make me dizzy and&mdash;and&mdash;"</p>

<p>She ceased her excuses suddenly and flung herself
in a chair beside the window, then seeing the
moon, she arose and turned down the gas, opening
the shutters that it might flood the room. She sat
still feeling strangely warmed by the cold rays. She
was looking backward through a little time, at that
dark head upon the crest of the waves, risking
life to save a crippled child whom he had never seen
before. She was living through her own torture
again with a curious, gentle thrill of ecstatic pleasure,
and then her heart gave a great, wild throb as
she saw him beside her upon the old pier, and&mdash;felt
his wet, cold, but still impassioned, kiss upon her
lips.</p>

<p>She hid her face as she remembered that&mdash;the face
that had suddenly flushed there under the silent,
never-betraying presence of the old moon, but,
strangely enough, it was not with shame but thrilling,
unacknowledged joy. There was a smile upon
her mouth as she removed her hands, and putting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
out her hands swiftly, she caught the damp jacket
from the back of the chair where Ahbel had hung
it to dry, and pressed her lips again and again upon
the place where his arm had touched.</p>

<p>And then an expression of wild dismay sprang
to her eyes. The smile fled from her lips. A hoarse
cry arose in her throat.</p>

<p>"It can't be&mdash;it can't be!" she moaned; "that what
she said is true. My God! it can't be that a curse
like that has been sent upon me!"</p>

<p>She paused breathlessly and suddenly, with the
jacket still clasped in her hands, her eyes raised to
the face of the moon; she went back further in memory,
and saw herself lying upon the couch on the
deck of the yacht, heard his softly murmured words
as he repeated Percy Shelley's poem, felt the touch
of his lips, warm and sweet upon her own again&mdash;and
then, for the first time, understood it all.</p>

<p>All the desire for happiness that one day, all the
wild longing to forget the past, all the breathless
sweetness of those moments alone with him, the
heavenly joy of that unrepulsed caress, the agony of
terror when his life was threatened, the exquisite
happiness that was almost pain when he was safe
once more beside her, with his arms, wet and dripping
about her&mdash;Dudley Maltby said she had offered
five thousand dollars for his life. God! she would
have given her whole fortune and have gone through
life a beggar for every one of the after years, if
they had numbered a thousand, to know that he was
safe.</p>

<p>She laughed aloud, such a strange, unfathomable
laugh, and staggered to her feet.</p>

<p>"Five thousand!" she cried, still laughing, though
there were glistening tears in her eyes that seemed
to blind her. "Five thousand! Let it go at once&mdash;at
once! I will draw the check and send it to the
captain of the 'Eolus,' to be filled in with the name<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
of the man who did it. Five thousand! I wish it
were every cent that I possess! I wish&mdash;"</p>

<p>She turned swiftly, excitedly, and turned up the
gas, then as she would have approached her escritoire,
her eye fell again upon the yellow telegram
lying there like a sentinel.</p>

<p>She took it up recklessly and tore off the envelope,
defying the figures to harm her; but it was not in
cipher. The cold, plain, torturing words flashed before
her eyes:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Everything ready to leave the moment papers
arrive. No fear of failure now.</p>

<p class="sig1">
"<span class="smcap">Stolliker.</span>"<br />
</p></blockquote>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXX" id="CHAPTER_XXX">CHAPTER XXX.</a></h2>


<p>"No fear of failure now&mdash;no fear of failure now!"</p>

<p>The words danced before her eyes in living, piercing
flame of scorching fire. "No fear of failure
now!" and her heart just awakened to the fact that
she loved this man whom she had hounded to destruction.
"No fear of failure now!" What was
that small, weak blundering affection she had borne
Olney Winthrop compared with this maddening,
anguished passion that was tearing her very soul to
despair? What was that frail, misunderstood liking,
that sympathy that was almost pity, to this
swirling, eddying tumult of adoration that filled her
breast to bursting?</p>

<p>And Stolliker had assured her, with a note of
triumph in the words which not even the electric
transmission had had power to destroy, that there
was "no fear of failure now."</p>

<p>She had told herself in those first days that she
hated him; but now she understood it all, cruelly,
bitterly&mdash;understood that she had deceived herself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
because she had heard those hateful words of Jessica's
about her birth; had heard his light laugh, and
that it was a scorching, searing jealousy that had
tormented her&mdash;nothing else. And now she was
punished&mdash;punished!</p>

<p>If she had but allowed herself to acknowledge
the love that Heaven had sent her, she might have
saved him the crime that he had committed; and, oh,
pitiful God, how well she understood that, too, now!
She had loved him from the beginning&mdash;from the
beginning! No other love had ever for an instant
occupied her heart. And this was her punishment!</p>

<p>It was she who had fixed the crime upon him;
she who had set the blood-hound of the law upon
his track; she who had paid thousands of dollars for
his conviction! And now it was too late to undo that
which she had done&mdash;too late to withdraw that evidence
which she would have walked blind and barefoot
over the whole world to destroy.</p>

<p>And God had sent this bitter grief, this awful despair
upon her because she had presumed to take
His authority in her own erring, human hands. It
was but just; and she loved him&mdash;she loved him!</p>

<p>She acknowledged it with a ghastly delight that
brought sickening anguish to her very soul. She
loved this murderer!</p>

<p>But what was she that she should judge him?
Surely she had been punished enough for sitting in
judgment.</p>

<p>And now, what should she do?</p>

<p>Let him go to the ruin and death to which she
had betrayed him? Lift no finger to prevent the
crisis which she had wrought?</p>

<p>The thought maddened her.</p>

<p>The telegram was clutched between her fingers.
Never pausing to consider, she turned and fled from
the room down the hall to Jessica's door. She tore
at the knob and flung it open.</p>

<p>Jessica was alone, fastening her white negligee at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
the throat. She turned, but was not kept long in
suspense by her visitor.</p>

<p>"For the love of God, look&mdash;look!" Carlita cried,
as she thrust the telegram before the eyes of her
supposed friend.</p>

<p>And taking it calmly from the shaking hand, Jessica
read it aloud:</p>

<p>"'Everything ready to leave the moment papers
arrive. No fear of failure now.'</p>

<p>"Well," she exclaimed, making no attempt to conceal
her smile of triumph, "surely you could desire
no more?"</p>

<p>"Desire no more!" repeated Carlita, hoarsely. "You
don't understand; you can't&mdash;you can't! For God's
sake, think for me! This must be stopped at once&mdash;at
once!"</p>

<p>"Are you mad?" demanded Jessica, coldly. "What
are you talking of?"</p>

<p>"Of this hideous crime that I have brought
about!" gasped Carlita. "Those papers must never
reach him&mdash;reach Stolliker. It must be prevented
at the cost of my very life, if needs be! We must
give up everything to purchase silence from Meriaz.
Oh, Jessica, for the love of Heaven, help me!"</p>

<p>"Help you defend a murderer? Help you protect
a criminal?"</p>

<p>"Don't&mdash;don't! You don't understand, I tell you.
It was I who drove him to it&mdash;I who should be
punished, if punishment must come to any one! He
loved me. I did not know the meaning of the word
then, but I know now&mdash;my God, so cruelly well!
Jessica, listen, and then comprehend all my humiliation,
if you can. I&mdash;I, who was the betrothed wife
of Olney Winthrop&mdash;I, who swore that infamous
oath to the dead&mdash;I, who have mercilessly hounded a
fellow-creature to the very jaws of perdition, love
him so well that I would take his crime upon my
own shoulders&mdash;yes, upon my own soul, and stand in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
the presence of God, stained and branded, to save
him! I am ready to stand your contempt, your loathing,
if you will but help me! Pity me&mdash;oh, merciful
God, pity me!"</p>

<p>She had fallen upon her knees at Jessica's feet,
her head bowed in her hands, her suffering too deep
for tears. But the woman witness did not offer to
touch her; she stepped back and folded her hands
coldly.</p>

<p>"You are too late," she said, with rigid cruelty.
"The papers will be in Stolliker's hands early tomorrow
morning."</p>

<p>A cry of horror left Carlita's lips.</p>

<p>"Tomorrow!" she groaned. "Tomorrow! It can't
be true&mdash;it can't be true!"</p>

<p>"It is," replied Jessica, in that hard, pitiless tone.
"And even if it were not, what would there be for
you to do? When Meriaz made the affidavit purchased
by you, the testimony went into the hands of
the law. Do you think the law will wilfully see a
murderer go unpunished because you&mdash;love him?
You must abide the consequences of your own act.
You have bought the proof of his guilt, you have
practically brought him face to face with the hangman's
noose, and it is too late for you to withdraw
from the position you have taken. You said you
would see the play through to the bitter end, and
there is no course left for you but to do it."</p>

<p>"But I did not understand!" Carlita groaned. "I
did not know!"</p>

<p>"Did not know that this guilty passion lurked in
your breast? Did not know you had fallen in love
with the murderer of one lover? Verily, it is
worthy reason!"</p>

<p>"Do you think I mind your contempt? The very
lash brings some ray of comfort to my soul. Go
on! I know now I deserve it all. Say everything,
only find some means to help me."</p>

<p>"There is no help&mdash;none earthly and I would not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
if I could. I am not aiding and abetting criminals.
I have fallen in love with no branded Cain. If you
can save those papers from reaching their destination,
and then close the mouth of Manuel Meriaz for
all time to come, you may hope to save this scoundrel
lover, but until you do his fate must lie in
the hands of an outraged law."</p>

<p>But Carlita seemed not to have heard the latter
part of the sentence at all. Her hands had suddenly
dropped from before her face, and into the despairing
eyes there leaped a ray of hope that irradiated
her whole countenance. She appeared for a moment
to be thinking deeply; then arose without a word,
and was hurrying toward the door, when Jessica
started forward and caught her by the wrist.</p>

<p>"Where are you going?" she demanded, huskily,
her excitement showing itself in her usually clear
voice.</p>

<p>"To him!" cried Carlita, passionately. "To him&mdash;to
tell him the whole foul story of my contemptible
sin&mdash;to warn him of his danger and beseech
him to fly!"</p>

<p>Jessica laughed&mdash;the hatefulest sound, perhaps,
that had ever issued from those handsome lips. She
dropped Carlita's wrist, and placed her back nonchalantly
against the door.</p>

<p>"Do you think that I will let you go?" she demanded,
coldly, calmly. "Do you think that I shall
let you leave this room?"</p>

<p>"You would not prevent me? What revenge have
you to win?"</p>

<p>A crimson flame seemed to lick out from the
brown eyes, and a dull red glow flashed into the
oval cheeks. She stretched her arms across the
door and bent her head toward her victim.</p>

<p>"What revenge have I to win?" she repeated, allowing
all the hatred of her nature full expression.
"What revenge have I to win? Listen and you
shall hear. Before you came into our lives, he&mdash;Leith<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
Pierrepont&mdash;loved me. But for you I should
have been his wife. I loved him. Pouf! what do
you know of love? What is your paltry, pitiful affection
for him compared to what mine has been?
But he turned from me to you&mdash;overlooked my love
for your toleration&mdash;passed me by, forsook me, and
I determined that he should pay for it with the last
drop of blood in his body! I hated you both, and
from the very first I have seen how it would be.
Did you think I did not know of your love for him?
Do you think I should have left you so long alone,
had it not been to allow it to grow until you should
suffer all that I had in store for you? Did you think
I meant that you should rob me of everything that
made life worth living, and then escape my vengeance?
You do not know me!"</p>

<p>A sneering sound like a laugh left her lips&mdash;hard,
cold&mdash;sending the blood tingling through Carlita's
veins with stinging rapidity. She had drawn herself
up, all the Mexican fire of her nature aroused
and in action. The pleading anguish had all vanished,
and only stern command remained.</p>

<p>"Stand aside!" she exclaimed in a voice as clear
and ringing as it had been hoarse and supplicating
before.</p>

<p>"Where are you going?" asked Jessica, imitating
the tone.</p>

<p>"To Leith Pierrepont," answered Carlita, ignoring
subterfuge.</p>

<p>Again Jessica laughed.</p>

<p>"You must be mad!" she replied. "Do you think
I will be robbed of my revenge in the eleventh
hour?"</p>

<p>"Let me pass!" Carlita commanded again, going
a step toward her.</p>

<p>"Never!"</p>

<p>For one dramatic moment the two determined
women faced each other, and then began a physical
struggle for mastery.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span></p>

<p>There was not a sound, not a cry until they both
tripped over a small embroidered footstool and fell,
Carlita's head striking the sharp edge of a table.</p>

<p>Jessica arose at once, panting, flushed, but Carlita
lay there, still as death, her face upturned, but
expressionless.</p>

<p>With fiendish hatred Jessica looked down upon
her, even touched her with the toe of her slipper,
but there was no movement to show that it had been
felt.</p>

<p>Calmly, deliberately, Jessica regarded herself in
the mirror, saw that her gown was in order, then
walked to her mother's door, and throwing it open,
said with cool distinctness:</p>

<p>"You'd better come into my room for a moment.
Carlita tripped over a stool and has hurt herself."</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXI" id="CHAPTER_XXXI">CHAPTER XXXI.</a></h2>


<p>"How is Miss de Barryos?"</p>

<p>Manuel Meriaz was standing facing Mrs. Chalmers
who had risen to greet him, endeavoring to
conceal her expression of repugnance, and succeeding
poorly, a smile upon his coarse lips which was
far from attractive, though he endeavored to make
his voice gentle, even human.</p>

<p>"All right again, I fancy," replied Mrs. Chalmers,
wearily.</p>

<p>"Still a prisoner?"</p>

<p>She made a gesture of deprecation.</p>

<p>"Jessica seems to have gone mad these last few
days," she answered. "She must realize how impossible
it is for this to go on longer, but she will
listen to no reason, hear no argument. She will confide
nothing to me, but is like a wild creature if I
attempt to speak to her."</p>

<p>"Let her alone," advised Meriaz, indifferently.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
"Stolliker will be here tomorrow, and it will all come
to an end quickly enough then."</p>

<p>"Stolliker here tomorrow? Who told you?"</p>

<p>"Jessica."</p>

<p>"Then she has talked to you?"</p>

<p>"No; nothing further than that. He telegraphed
from Washington yesterday that he would stop off
in New York while the Mexican officer, with an
interpreter from the office here, would go on to
Albany for the signature of the governor to those
papers. By tomorrow night, or the next at furthest
their bird will be landed, and then I fancy Jessica
will let your beautiful ward take her own
course."</p>

<p>"Shall you return to Mexico with them?"</p>

<p>"Certainly. That is necessary in order to pocket
the rest of the money."</p>

<p>Mrs. Chalmers could not quite control the sigh of
relief that bubbled through her lips in spite of effort.</p>

<p>Meriaz smiled.</p>

<p>"You will go with me, Louise?"</p>

<p>"I?" she stammered.</p>

<p>"Yes. You have always told me that it was a
question of money that kept us apart. With the
start I shall have when this trial is over I should
have to be a poor financier indeed, if I could not
make my fortune."</p>

<p>"But you will&mdash;wait until you have made it?</p>

<p>"Ah, no! You will give me the encouragement of
your presence."</p>

<p>She looked up at him helplessly, like a bird under
the influence of a serpent, and saw the expression of
his countenance. It was almost diabolical in its
fiendish intent.</p>

<p>She shrank backward, and he sat down opposite
her.</p>

<p>"My dear Louise," he said slowly "you and I
have played at this game long enough. There was
a time when I was fool enough to believe in you.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
There was a time when you led me on, inducing
me to do your bidding, let that be what it might,
merely for a word in recompense, flung at me like
a bone to a starving dog; but I have learned something
different now. I am grateful to you for my
education. No one to look at me would believe
that there was a time when I was a gentleman, when
people called me handsome, when I was a dashing
man of the world, who might have captured the
richest senorita in all Mexico. You are responsible
that I did not, my dear Louise. I loved you then,
and there is nothing under heaven that you might
have commanded which I would not do. You knew
your power, and you used it. Well, Louise, the
tables have turned. I don't love you now. Perhaps
I have grown too old to love. Perhaps I have forgotten
how; but I know my power over you now,
and I mean to use it."</p>

<p>"What are you going&mdash;to do?" she stammered,
hoarsely.</p>

<p>He leaned toward her, fixing her with his beady
eyes, and answered calmly:</p>

<p>"Marry you&mdash;and give my daughter her honest
name!"</p>

<p>"For God's sake, hush!" she exclaimed, springing
up and glancing about her in alarm.</p>

<p>He put his hand upon her arm, and forced her
gently into her seat again.</p>

<p>"Any one would think I had proposed a crime,"
he said, quietly, "from your frightened tone and exclamation.
I don't call it a very bitter revenge, do
you, that I propose to make you my wife? I don't
call it a great hardship, that for the first time in all
your life you will be able to face yourself and the
world as a legal wife, bearing the name of a husband
that is willing to claim you before all the
world!"</p>

<p>"What do&mdash;you mean?" she gasped, her voice almost
uncontrollable in its tremulousness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span></p>

<p>"Don't imagine that you can deceive me!" he
exclaimed, contemptuously. "I am quite aware that
Bertram Chalmers was a myth. I know your life,
Louise, year by year, day by day, almost hour by
hour, from the time you were a school-girl, and even
before. There is not an incident that I could not
repeat to you with such exactitude as to be almost
startling. I doubt if you could recite it so well yourself.
But there are only a few years with which
I have to do. You were young, beautiful, when
you came to Mexico, where your little one was born.
It was in your way, poor little morsel, and you
abandoned it. What did you care whether it was
brought up in the hut of a peon, or left to die in
the sun-scorched swamps? I saw you then and
loved you, in spite of your heartlessness, for we
know little of sin in Mexico. It is only love that
affects us. I was the only person about that attracted
you then, and you yielded to me your smiles
for the time, only, as I afterward discovered, to
make me your tool, to force me to do that which
you could not do yourself. I became your dupe,
your accomplice at cards&mdash;no matter what. I do
not regret a single sin that I ever committed for
you, a single folly. If you had loved me, you would
have found that I knew better than most men how
to be a devoted slave, but you didn't. And after a
time you returned to America. What became of
your abandoned little one? I know, Louise!"</p>

<p>"You&mdash;know?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"She lives?"</p>

<p>"It can't be that you are interested after all these
years!" he cried, mockingly. "Yes, she lives."</p>

<p>"Where? For Heaven's sake, tell me!</p>

<p>"In Mexico, known as&mdash;my daughter. Ah! you
see I loved you better even than you thought. She
has grown to be a beautiful woman, but not like her
mother. Your hair in those days was dark, Louise,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
though your eyes were blue. Her eyes are dark.
Her hair black as night. Brought up in that tropical
climate, she possesses all the attributes of a Mexican,
even to the hot, ungovernable temper&mdash;tender
and impulsive as a child under love's direction, but
a fury, a very fiend, when opposition comes. She
wants to know her mother, Louise."</p>

<p>"You&mdash;you have&mdash;told her?" the dry, stiff lips
questioned.</p>

<p>"Everything! She even knows the secret of Jessica's
birth, the&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ah!"</p>

<p>"Did you think I did not know that?" he questioned
calmly in answer to her little, inarticulate cry
of horror. "I thought I told you that everything
was an open page to me? Shall I tell you what it
was I told her, Louise?"</p>

<p>No answer came, only the anguish in the burning
eyes. He went on pitilessly:</p>

<p>"I told her that Jessica is&mdash;my daughter. Great
God, woman! did you really think you could deceive
me? Did you really believe I did not know?
I have only bided my time, waiting, waiting, because,
as you said neither of us had a sou with
which to bless ourselves. With all your swindling
and lying and cheating you did not make enough
even for your own support, and I had nothing to
add to it to speak of. But now things are different.
I shall have a start. It will enable me to work
the mines, which are of great promise, and I want
my daughter to bear her proper name."</p>

<p>"You mean to tell Jessica this story?"</p>

<p>Meriaz shrugged his shoulders indifferently.</p>

<p>"You are an expert at manufacturing stories. If
you can invent one that will deceive her and still
induce her to do my will, I shall have no objection
to you telling it. Otherwise, she must know the
truth."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span></p>

<p>"Have you no mercy?" moaned the woman,
wringing her hands together helplessly.</p>

<p>"What mercy had you upon me? What mercy
had you upon that poor little helpless child whom
you abandoned? Why is it that it is always the
person who has done most harm in the world that
is always crying out for mercy? Did you think you
should be allowed to go through the world scot-free,
you who have worked so much harm, you who
have driven so many men to desperation, and
broken the hearts of countless wives? I am not
taunting you with your sins; why should I? Heaven
knows I have no stones to cast; but when my time
comes I shall face my punishment with as much indifference
as I have committed crime. And, after
all, what is it that I am offering you? Is it so great
a shame to be the wife of any man, you who have
borne no name that was justly yours since you wilfully
dropped the one your father gave you? Louise,
when will you be my wife?"</p>

<p>"You must give me time!" she groaned.</p>

<p>He bowed.</p>

<p>"I have already given you twenty years in which
to consider it," he returned, lightly. "I suppose
another day will make no difference. I give you,
then, until tomorrow, when Stolliker returns. I
go as a member of that party, remember, and you
must accompany me. We shall be a happy family;
you united to your long-neglected child, I to my
daughter whom I have allowed you to keep during
all these years. I shall expect your answer when
Stolliker returns to take his prisoner."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXII" id="CHAPTER_XXXII">CHAPTER XXXII.</a></h2>


<p>Carlita was seated beside the window in her own
apartment, her hands folded listlessly over the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
folds of her white negligee gown, her head resting
against the back of her chair as if she suffered from
physical as well as mental exhaustion.</p>

<p>She seemed to have grown old in those few days.
There were heavy lines about her mouth, and under
her eyes dark circles that gave her a curious
expression of dumb anguish. She had lost in flesh,
until her cheeks appeared hollow and gaunt.</p>

<p>She glanced up when the door opened suddenly;
but there was neither wonder nor interest in the
look&mdash;scarcely even intelligence.</p>

<p>It was Jessica who had entered, and behind her
was Edmond Stolliker, the detective. Miss Chalmers
went forward and leaned indolently against
the corner of the dressing-table, looking coldly at
Carlita; but Stolliker stopped short, scarcely believing
his patroness to be the same beautiful girl who
had engaged him upon a murder case so short a
time before.</p>

<p>He was too good a detective, however, to allow
his surprise long expression, but listened with interest
while Jessica said:</p>

<p>"Carlita, this is Mr. Stolliker, your detective. I
told him that you were ill, but he insisted upon
seeing you, or delivering his message to no one.
Tell him he may speak out plainly in my presence."</p>

<p>The last sentence was almost a command and
Stolliker saw the white, almost transparent hands
drawn closer together in the lap, the colorless face
showing a dawning interest, a strange light creeping
into the leaden eye.</p>

<p>"Miss de Barryos," he exclaimed, taking a step
toward her and stooping suddenly, "I very greatly
regret that you are ill!"</p>

<p>"It is nothing," she returned, no trace of the old
musical voice noticeable in the hoarse, expressionless
tones.</p>

<p>"I am sure what I have to tell you will aid in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
your recovery. Everything that you most desired
has been accomplished. Even before the papers
arrived bringing the affidavit of Manuel Meriaz, I
had an officer prepared to start at once, the only
thing required being the signature to our requests
for extradition. We stopped over in Washington
and secured the consent of the Secretary of State;
then I returned here at once, while Carpano, the
Mexican officer, with one of the interpreters from
our office, went on to Albany for the signature of
the governor. I expect him to return this evening.
We shall make our arrest as quickly as possible
after the papers are in my possession. Presumably,
therefore, it will take place tonight, as Pierrepont
will be most liable to be found in his rooms at that
time, and we want no error now that we have succeeded
so far."</p>

<p>Carlita did not speak. But for that curious, dull
light in her eyes, Stolliker might have doubted that
she heard him at all. He waited for a moment,
then continued:</p>

<p>"With your permission, I will wait upon you tomorrow
morning, after he is in custody, to make a
full and complete report before we return to Mexico
with our prisoner and Manuel Meriaz, the witness
who is of such vital value to us."</p>

<p>She merely inclined her head ever so slightly; and
feeling more uncomfortable than he had ever done
under the most trying of circumstances, Stolliker
glanced toward Jessica.</p>

<p>He observed the smile of triumph and contempt
which she could not conceal.</p>

<p>"I think that is all, Miss Chalmers," he said,
carelessly.</p>

<p>She led the way from the room; and as they were
passing through the hall, Stolliker caught sight of
Ahbel, his niece. He made a quick deft sign to
her, which she answered simply by a glance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span></p>

<p>"You say this arrest will be made tonight?" Jessica
questioned, before he left her.</p>

<p>"I think so."</p>

<p>"At what hour? You need not be afraid to trust
me. I am absolutely in the confidence of Miss de
Barryos. She and I have sent the telegrams to you
together, and translated yours in return. I know
the development of this case step by step. Manuel
Meriaz was an old friend of my father."</p>

<p>Stolliker bowed.</p>

<p>"It will be impossible for me to say the exact
hour that the arrest will be made," he returned.
"The train from Albany is due about nine o'clock.
Good-afternoon, Miss Chalmers."</p>

<p>He left by the front door, but two minutes later
was admitted noiselessly by the servants' entrance.</p>

<p>"What's up?" he asked of Ahbel, when they were
secure from interruption.</p>

<p>"I don't know," she returned. "I can't make
out."</p>

<p>"Then you are a poor assistant for a detective.
How long has Miss de Barryos been ill?"</p>

<p>"Only a few days."</p>

<p>"What caused it?"</p>

<p>"She tripped over a stool in leaving Miss Chalmers'
room and hurt her head. She was unconscious
for so long that the doctor feared concussion
of the brain; but she seems to have avoided that
extremity, though she is not in the least like herself.
There are times when I think she has lost
her mind. She rarely ever speaks, but sits by the
window doing nothing, apparently not even thinking."</p>

<p>"Humph!" muttered Stolliker, remembering the
suddenly dawning interest in the sunken eyes.</p>

<p>"How long has this been going on?"</p>

<p>"It was a week ago yesterday that the accident
happened."</p>

<p>"She and Miss Chalmers were great friends?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes; but what struck us all as strange was that
Miss Chalmers did not go near her when the accident
happened, nor for two days afterward, though
it occurred in her room."</p>

<p>"Humph! Does Pierrepont come here now?"</p>

<p>"He has been here every day to inquire for Miss
de Barryos, most days twice."</p>

<p>"Who sees him?"</p>

<p>"Miss Chalmers."</p>

<p>Stolliker lifted his eyebrows slightly.</p>

<p>"How long does he remain?"</p>

<p>"Not long. He has seemed dreadfully depressed
since Miss de Barryos' illness."</p>

<p>"Is there anything else?"</p>

<p>"I don't think so."</p>

<p>"The whole case strikes me as a very singular
one," said Stolliker, musing. "My own opinion is
that we shall have another one to ferret out as soon
as Pierrepont is safely off our hands. I want you to
help me, Ahbel. You think you can?"</p>

<p>"I can try."</p>

<p>"Keep your eyes on Miss Chalmers and notify me
of everything she does. If she enters Miss de Barryos'
room, be sure you hear the conversation that
takes place, and send me a detailed account of it
at once. I'll have Tommy Ferris opposite. If you
want him put that scarlet geranium in the window
and he will come at once. If there is anything that
you can do for Miss de Barryos, be sure you do it.
My opinion is that she is a prisoner in her own
room."</p>

<p>"A prisoner?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Now that I have suggested the idea, is
there anything you can remember that would confirm
the suspicion?"</p>

<p>"Yes, there is, but I should not have thought of
it. Unless Miss Chalmers is in her room the nurse
never leaves, not for a single moment. She even
sleeps there at night and watches me when I am in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
the room like a cat would watch a mouse. She
even refused to allow me to go in at all for a
time."</p>

<p>"Ah! I thought so. Bide your time, and if you
get a chance, go in there when Miss de Barryos is
alone. You might manufacture some excuse for
getting the woman out for a moment. My own
opinion is that Miss de Barryos is suffering from
some terrible mental trouble, and this apparent
apathy is simply feigned to carry some point she
has in view. You must help to discover whether I
am right, or whether her accident and the worry
over this case has caused the dreadful change in
her. Remember, I depend upon you."</p>

<p>"I will do what is possible, for her sake, I know
she was in some terrible trouble; but the night of
the accident she seemed in better spirits than for a
long time."</p>

<p>Stolliker did not wait to hear more, but slipped
out of the house as noiselessly as he had entered,
only pausing to whisper one sentence into his niece's
ear:</p>

<p>"Be sure you inform me of everything Miss Chalmers
does."</p>

<p>She smiled without reply and closed the door
upon him, then went slowly upstairs, wondering
how she was to obey his injunction and what there
would be to report. It was her first experience in
detective work, and she was naturally excited.</p>

<p>Jessica stood alone in her room reading a note
which a messenger had just left. The hand that
held it trembled slightly, and she walked nearer to
the window to read, although the light was still good,
as it was not late.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My Dear Jessica</span>"&mdash;she read&mdash;"I will be unable
to call this afternoon, on account of a matter
of grave importance, but shall be most anxious
about Carlita. You are so good to me&mdash;have been
so good during all this distressing illness of hers&mdash;that
I am sure you will not think it too much
trouble to send me a line concerning her condition,
which will reach me upon my return at eight o'clock
this evening. Please let it arrive as near that hour
as you can, so that I may receive the latest news,
and know if any change has taken place. Yours
gratefully and affectionately,</p>

<p class="sig1">
"<span class="smcap">Leith Pierrepont.</span>"<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>She read it through the second time, then crushed
it in her hand, smiling grimly.</p>

<p>"Eight o'clock," she mused. "And Stolliker
said the train from Albany arrived about nine, with
the Mexican officer on board. I wonder if you
would have written in a hand so firm if you had
been aware of the sword that hangs above your head,
my dear Leith? I wonder if the consuming tenderness
of this great affection will receive a shock
when you hear the truth tonight? How little we
know in the morning the climax of the day!"</p>

<p>During all the remaining hours of the afternoon
she sat quite still, thinking, thinking, planning, only
once going to Carlita's room, but returning to her
own when she saw that all there was as it had been.
She even locked the door upon her mother, and
would allow no entrance. She denied her maid admission,
but going to the door, exclaimed:</p>

<p>"A cup of tea&mdash;that is all. But strong, strong&mdash;strong,
mind you!"</p>

<p>She took it with her own hands, locked the door,
drank it without either sugar, cream, or even lemon,
and then with steady hand began to dress herself.</p>

<p>She had never been so careful in the arrangement
of her hair, never so particular in the selection<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
of her costume, never so dissatisfied with herself
when the operation was completed.</p>

<p>It was a street-gown she had donned, but not the
tailor-made which she ordinarily wore on such occasions.
It was a little French thing in tan and
cerise, with a tiny violet bonnet that sat jauntily
upon her well-poised head, and to one less exacting
than herself had never appeared to better advantage.
She was really more than beautiful, more
than fascinating as she turned from the mirror and
looked at the clock.</p>

<p>"A quarter to eight," she muttered. "I shall be
waiting for you when you arrive, my dear Leith,
instead of the note you expect."</p>

<p>She drew on her gloves, and then alone and unattended
left the house.</p>

<p>She had not ordered her carriage, but when she
reached the corner called one and gave the address
to the coachman. She dismissed him at the door of
Leith's apartment. The hall-boy looked at her
curiously when she requested to be directed to Leith's
apartments, but showed her there without a word,
and Leith's valet admitted her to his presence.</p>

<p>"Mr. Pierrepont is at home," he answered in reply
to her question. "He came in not five minutes
ago."</p>

<p>Leith turned and came swiftly toward her when
he saw who it was that had entered, taking both
her hands in his and pressing them softly, as some
of the color brought by the cutting March wind receded
from his cheeks.</p>

<p>"What is it?" he asked swiftly. "Something
must have happened to bring you. Carlita! How
is she?"</p>

<p>A little curl of scorn flashed over Jessica's lips.
Carlita! Always Carlita! She was risking her reputation
in coming to him, yet his first thought was
of Carlita!</p>

<p>She paused to draw off her gloves before replying,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
he watching her breathlessly. He placed a
chair for her, but she motioned him aside and stood
leaning against the mantel-shelf, as she had often
seen him do in happier times. When she spoke,
there was a repressed, nervous hoarseness in her
tone that gave a sort of uncanny earnestness to her
words.</p>

<p>"I have not come about Carlita," she said, "save
incidentally. It is something connected with&mdash;you,
with your own vital interests, that has tempted me
to brave the censure of the world&mdash;to risk my reputation."</p>

<p>Leith smiled.</p>

<p>"It is not quite so bad as that," he said, soothingly.
"My reputation is not so dreadful that your
own is compromised by coming to my rooms."</p>

<p>"There isn't time to stand on trifles," she interrupted,
dropping her arm from the mantel and going
a step nearer to him. "Moments are precious, and
yet I find it very difficult to say that which I must.
You are standing in the most deadly peril! At any
moment it may be too late to save yourself&mdash;and I
have come to warn you!"</p>

<p>"What can you mean?" asked Leith, the smile
fading.</p>

<p>"You are accused of the murder of Olney Winthrop!"</p>

<p>"I? Are you mad?"</p>

<p>"Heaven knows I wish I were, but it is too infamously
true. Even now the detective, with an
officer from Mexico, are here to arrest you and return
you there. And the woman whom you have
loved, the woman you would have made your wife,
the woman in whose pretended illness you have
shown such interest, is the person who has hatched
the plot, who has bought your conviction, who has
won the contempt and loathing of all men by promising
to become your wife in order to betray you to
the gallows!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span></p>

<p>She had gone up to him and was looking up into
his eyes, which had become glassy and blood-shot,
but after a moment's awful pause he turned from her
with a little gesture of disbelief.</p>

<p>"Good God!" he muttered. "To accuse&mdash;her&mdash;of
that!"</p>

<p>"It is true! I swear to you it is true!" cried Jessica,
desperately. "It was she who accused you to
the detective whom she sent to discover proof of
your crime. She told him that you loved her, that
you had killed your best friend in order that you
might steal his promised wife from him. She sent
Edmond Stolliker there, had the body of Olney Winthrop
exhumed, and discovered that you had lied,
that he had not been shot, but had been suffocated
in a mine!"</p>

<p>Pierrepont groaned.</p>

<p>She paused just long enough to allow her words
full force, then continued rapidly:</p>

<p>"She detained you by her side by every means at
her avail until Stolliker should obtain such proof
as was necessary for your conviction, and while he
was there seeking it, paying thousands of dollars
for it if necessary, for she had put her entire fortune
at his command, Manuel Meriaz came here. You
remember the evening at our house? You and he
left the drawing-room together. She left the poker-table
and followed. She listened to your conversation
from behind a portière that screens the library
from an anteroom, and the following day she sent
for Meriaz. She purchased from him a story, bought
it with gold, of how you had gone for a walk with
Olney, and when you were in a lonely and deserted
place, you had pushed him down the old Donato
Mine, where he was suffocated with the gases before
any one could go to his assistance. She had
him make affidavit to this, and sent it to Stolliker
in Mexico. On this story he has obtained papers
of extradition, and will arrest you tonight."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span></p>

<p>"And Carlita has done this?"</p>

<p>"She has."</p>

<p>"But less than a week ago she offered five thousand
dollars to the man who would save my life!"</p>

<p>"It was in order that she might not lose her cherished
revenge at the last hour. She promised to
be your wife to keep you here. She loathes you
with all the fierce hatred of her Mexican nature."</p>

<p>Pierrepont groaned. There were so many things
that he remembered in that moment. Her desire
that their engagement should not be announced,
her cry to him: "Can't you see that I am only
doing it to betray you to ruin and death?" Was not
that confirmation of what Jessica had said? He
groaned again.</p>

<p>"And she believes me guilty of this crime!" he
cried, covering his suffering face with his hands.
"She believes that I killed Olney, and in this dastardly
way!"</p>

<p>His back was toward Jessica. She crept up to
him, and before he was aware of her intention her
arms were about him, those shining, seductive arms
that she knew so well how to use.</p>

<p>"Ah, Leith," she murmured, softly, "if she had
really loved you, she would have known you never
did it; but the toils are about you so strong that
Hercules himself could not break them. There is
but one way, dear, and that lies in my power. I
can save you, Leith. I have thought day and night
since all the details of this sickening story came to
me, and I have found the way. I&mdash;oh, Leith, you
will forgive me in an hour like this, will you not?&mdash;I
love you! So well, that not even your indifference
has had power to kill that love! I would go
through life your too willing slave but to be permitted
to love you, to be near you, to serve you.
You have thought me hard and cold and cruel sometimes;
reckless, too, and careless of what I did, but it
has only been because of this indifference of yours<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
which has been killing me! Look in my face and
read the truth, Leith! See! I have lost all shame,
all fear! It is swallowed up in my great love. I
can save you, dear, and I will, and all I ask in return
is that you let me love you. I do not even
ask for yours in return, now, because I know when
you have seen the depth and strength of my devotion,
it will come in time! Leith&mdash;darling&mdash;will you
let me save you?"</p>

<p>"Save me from what?" he questioned, stonily.</p>

<p>"From the cruel death that she has prepared for
you! From the shame and humiliation she would
heap upon you! I tell you she has bought your
conviction with her gold!"</p>

<p>"And what is it that you propose to have me do?"
he asked, his voice hard and cold as iron.</p>

<p>"Fly with me!" she exclaimed, breathlessly. "Only
until such time as this story can be proved in all its
falsity. Show her that you do not care. Show her
that she has not hurt you with this foul lie that
she has concocted. Leith, come with me!"</p>

<p>He laughed aloud, his mouth rigid and drawn
while the grewsome sound escaped, and loosened her
fingers from his neck.</p>

<p>"No!" he cried, heavily. "I will await the officers
she has sent here. I will stand the trial she has prepared."</p>

<p>"But there will be no possibility of escape for
you. I tell you that, innocent or guilty, there will
be no possibility of escape!"</p>

<p>"Then I will die upon the gallows!"</p>

<p>"Leith, you must be mad! Is the thought of life
with me so hard to bear? Is death at her hands
preferable to life and love at mine?"</p>

<p>"Yes," he cried savagely, fiercely, "it is! If she
has purchased my ruin, she shall have it. If she
wishes me to stand trial for this crime I will do it!"</p>

<p>"For God's sake, listen to reason!" Jessica panted.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
"You can't know what you are doing. You can't
realize what those people are."</p>

<p>"Do you think I would fly from a crime I never
committed?"</p>

<p>"But they will give you no opportunity to prove
your innocence. They will lock you up in one of
their awful prisons, from which there will be no escape
but death. What care have they for life?
What is a soul to them? If they would kill you for
a coat, they would betray you to the gallows for
less than a hundred dollars. For the love of Heaven,
listen to reason! Hark! There is a ring at the
bell. It must be Stolliker and the officer. Leith,
the last moment is here! Think quick, and answer
me! Will you let me save you?"</p>

<p>"No!"</p>

<p>"Oh, Leith, Leith I love you! It is life with me
or death for her and without her. Listen: they are
in the hall. For God's sake, come!"</p>

<p>He did not speak. His face was white and set as
marble. His lips were compressed to a straight line;
his eyes burned fiercely. He threw his arm about
her and led her quickly to a side door. She thought
he had yielded to her entreaties, but he thrust her
inside the room without even a murmured word of
thanks for her effort to save him, closed the door
and turned the key in the lock, then faced the other
door through which his visitor must enter.</p>

<p>Already it had been flung open.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXIV" id="CHAPTER_XXXIV">CHAPTER XXXIV.</a></h2>


<p>"Carlita!"</p>

<p>The name escaped him in a hoarse, gasping cry
as she staggered across the room toward him, her
frail strength almost exhausted in her effort to reach
him. She would have fallen there at his feet, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
that he caught her in his arms, and as he would
have placed her in a chair she caught the lapels of
his coat and held herself close to him by the very
strength of despair.</p>

<p>"No!" she gasped. "Give me courage by the
strength of your touch to tell my awful story. If
you turn from me I shall die before it is finished,
and then all will be lost! I told you that I was betraying
you to ruin and death, but you would not
believe me, would not listen. Great God, Leith, it
was so hideously true! Do you know what I have
done? Will you despise me, when you have heard,
as I despise myself?"</p>

<p>He looked down at her. Knowing what he knew,
he still could not keep his arms from supporting
her. Knowing what he knew, he could force his
lips to say no word of blame.</p>

<p>"Let me hide my face while I tell you!" she cried,
concealing it in his bosom. "I have betrayed you!
I have sought your ruin! I discovered that you had
killed Olney Winthrop&mdash;see? I can say it without
so much as a shiver now&mdash;and I have put you in the
hands of the law with every chain of the ghastly
story complete. They are coming even now to arrest
you. There is not a moment to lose. You must
go at once!"</p>

<p>He held her back from him and strove to look at
her downcast face.</p>

<p>"Why have you come here to tell me this?" he
asked hoarsely. "Now that you have about accomplished
your revenge, why do you warn me of
the danger?"</p>

<p>It never occurred to her to wonder at his apparent
knowledge of it all. She only cried out in an
agony of remorse:</p>

<p>"Why, don't you understand without my telling
you? Don't you see it all? I love you! Surely you
know that. Surely you have read it from the beginning,
even when I was so hideously unconscious.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
I have loved you from the first, best of all, and I
love you now as it never seemed possible that any
human thing could love. I would give my life, my
very soul itself to undo this awful thing that I have
done!"</p>

<p>"And yet you believe me guilty of this crime?"</p>

<p>"What right have I to judge you?" she cried,
feverishly, endeavoring to remove her face from his
gaze. "What do I know of your temptation? Oh,
just God, it is that which has cursed me! I shut my
eyes to the sweetest sentiment He ever put into a
human soul, and set myself up to usurp His authority&mdash;to
avenge! This is my punishment. See, Leith,
I do not endeavor to conceal my face. I do not try
to hide my shame. If you go to the gallows, I go
too, for the crime is half mine. I have striven not
to lose my reason during these last few, awful days
when I was kept a prisoner in my own room, from
which I have only now escaped in order that I might
know all that was taking place, in order that I might
die with you!"</p>

<p>"Wait, Carlita! You are speaking so wildly that
I don't quite follow you. You say&mdash;"</p>

<p>"There isn't time!" she gasped. "There isn't
time! They may be here at any moment, and you
must make your escape before they come. I will
find some means of throwing them off the track&mdash;of
preventing their following you until your escape is
assured. But you must go at once&mdash;at once!"</p>

<p>He looked at her curiously, a strange expression
crossing his face.</p>

<p>"With you?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I will follow you, if you wish it!" she cried, desperately.
"You can find some means of communicating
with me&mdash;of letting me know where you are&mdash;and
I swear I will come to you when you send."</p>

<p>"Believing me to be a&mdash;murderer?"</p>

<p>She shivered.</p>

<p>"We will never mention that between us," she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
groaned. "We will begin a new life&mdash;a new life in
a new country&mdash;and forget. Oh, Leith, there is no
more time! For God's sake&mdash;for my sake&mdash;go!"</p>

<p>He smiled and kissed her.</p>

<p>For some reason the ghastly whiteness had disappeared
from his countenance. He held her very
closely in his arms, observing that she did not
shrink from the embrace. He lifted her face so
that her lips rested close to his own, as he said
gently:</p>

<p>"How great must be the strength of love when
innocence does not turn away appalled at guilt.
Darling, suppose I should tell you that I do not
fear the coming of these men? Suppose I should
tell you that I do not fear the investigation of all
the world, because I am innocent of the crime with
which I have been charged&mdash;because I was not even
by when Olney was pushed into the Donato Mine?"</p>

<p>She staggered back from him, her face growing
whiter, more sunken than it had been before. She
did not touch him then, but as he would have taken
her again in his arms, motioned him back, passing
her hands across her eyes to clear her vision.</p>

<p>"I thought to spare you and&mdash;and him," Leith
cried swiftly, hurrying through the tale, because he
saw how she was suffering; "but I have realized
now that nothing under heaven will justify a lie.
That was my sin, Carlita; but nothing beyond that,
I swear to you. Half an hour ago I would have
scorned to justify myself in your eyes, but such love
as yours does not come into the lives of many men.
Listen, darling. Even in those old days when you
scorned me, I loved you so well that I wished to
spare you any pain that it lay in my power to save
you from. I knew your pure white innocence and
the suffering it would entail upon you to discover
that the lover you had chosen in preference to me
was not the man you had pictured him. Carlita, a
woman's idea of a man&mdash;particularly a young girl's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
brought up in the untarnished school you were&mdash;and
a man's idea of a man are not the same. You demand
purity of him as he demands it of you, and
while Olney was my friend&mdash;while I loved him like
a brother&mdash;I wished to save you from a knowledge
of&mdash;his past. Two years ago, when Olney was in
Mexico he met a girl with whom he thought he fell
in love. She was a hot-blooded Mexican, who loved
him in return, but with a sort of savage ferocity.
She was the daughter of Manuel Meriaz. When
Olney left Mexico there was some kind of an understanding
between them&mdash;a relationship with which I
would not offend your pure ears. But Olney forgot
her in a short time. When he went back to Mexico,
I believe he had ceased to remember her very existence;
but she had not forgotten him. She and her
father were at the mines. She reminded Olney of
his old promise to marry her. She even pleaded with
him to keep his word. She loved him fondly, and&mdash;well
Carlita, he should have made good his broken
troth, because there was a&mdash;a little infant in Mexico&mdash;a
tiny dead child, upon whose tomb there was no
name."</p>

<p>"Great God!"</p>

<p>"Olney could not be brought to see the justice
in her claim, because he loved you, and one day,
after a violent scene, in which she besought him to
make good the old promise, for their dead baby's
sake, there, under the desolation of the forsaken
mine, where she had summoned him for a rendezvous,
she pushed him to his death. I swear to you
that I do not believe she meant to kill him, and so,
in pity for her blighted life, I tried to save her from
the punishment of her crime&mdash;to save him from the
shame of public infamy, and you from the bitter
knowledge of it all. Manuel Meriaz knew this
story. He cared little enough, Heaven knows, for
the disgrace of the poor girl, so long as he could
gain money through it, and so I bought his silence,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
which he had discovered was of value to me because
of my affection for Olney and my love for you.
Carlita, before God, this is all the truth!"</p>

<p>They were both so interested that they had not
heard the opening of the front door again, nor the
low-spoken words in the hall, for Carlita had fallen
upon her knees at the feet of the man she loved.</p>

<p>"Father in heaven, the punishment is greater than
I can bear!" she was crying aloud, in her agony.
"Innocent! Innocent, and I have&mdash;"</p>

<p>But already she was in his arms, the wild words
hushed by his passionate kisses.</p>

<p>"Darling," he whispered, "my full forgiveness is
measured by the magnitude of your love. I should
have told you&mdash;I should have trusted you."</p>

<p>And then, as he lifted his head, he saw two men
standing already inside the door&mdash;Stolliker and the
Mexican officer in uniform.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXV" id="CHAPTER_XXXV">CHAPTER XXXV.</a></h2>


<p>In all his experience as a detective, it is doubtful
if Edmond Stolliker was ever so surprised as at
the tableau that faced him as he entered Leith Pierrepont's
room.</p>

<p>He stood there dumb, stunned, too bewildered to
speak, and it was Leith himself who came to his
assistance.</p>

<p>He put Carlita aside, gently placing her in a chair,
where she sat rigidly upright, her eyes fixed upon
the two men helplessly, hopelessly, in spite of her
belief now in Leith's innocence, her hands clasped
tightly, then he stepped forward.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen," he exclaimed, proudly, though as
nonchalantly as he had ever spoken in his life, his
handsome head flung up, not defiantly, but inviting
examination, "I know why you have come here;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
have just heard it from the lips of this young lady&mdash;my
affianced wife, and I am ready to go with you.
It would be useless for me to assert my innocence
of this infamous charge to you, as I know you are
compelled to do that which your commanding officers
have instructed you to do, but I hope there will be
no scene about the arrest whatever. I will accompany
you quietly wherever you desire, only stipulating
that I be granted a few minutes' conversation
with Miss de Barryos, in your presence if needs be,
though I confess I should prefer not."</p>

<p>It gave Stolliker time, and he managed to catch
his breath.</p>

<p>"It is not at all necessary, sir," he said, recovering
from his half-dazed stupidity. "The fact is, that
Carpano has just received a telegram from his chief
which makes it unnecessary for you to return with
us to Mexico at all."</p>

<p>"What!"</p>

<p>Carlita had sprung to her feet, a tide of crimson
color surging through her cheeks, brow and throat,
a wild light had sprung to her eyes, and the exclamation
was little more than a hoarse cry of gladness
wrung through her white, tortured lips.</p>

<p>Leith stepped quickly forward and placed his arm
about her for much required support. Stolliker
smiled.</p>

<p>"The fact is, sir," he continued, "the telegram
announced that a search of the Donato Mine revealed
a scrap of paper which Mr. Winthrop had torn
from a note-book before the gases of the mine
overcame him, upon which he had written something
to the effect that he had fallen there purely
by accident, and that no one was responsible but
his own carelessness. But it seems from the meager
details we have been able to gain so far, that when
the contents of the scrap of paper became known,
Senorita Meriaz fell into violent hysteria, claiming
that he had written it to screen her, for she had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
pushed him there to his death, intending to kill
him. She testified to the statement, before witnesses,
and then&mdash;it may be that her heart broke, poor
girl, for the telegram contains the further information
that she died less than an hour afterward."</p>

<p>For all the fact that Carlita's arms were about
his neck, in spite of the presence of those two supposedly
unsympathetic men, and that Carlita's tears
were flowing freely in wildest happiness, a shadow
of regret lay in Leith's grave eyes.</p>

<p>"It is the happiest fate that could have overtaken
her," he said, gently. "Heaven knows I am sorry
for her, and would have shielded her had the power
been left me, but her own misery was too great to
be borne. And now may I ask how it happened
that you came to tell me this?"</p>

<p>"It seems rather a peculiar story to me, sir,"
Stolliker answered, "understanding as little of it
as I do, but you or Miss de Barryos may be able to
supply all that I can not tell. When I went this
morning to call upon Miss de Barryos, the manner
of my reception and the fact that I was denied admission
into her presence until I had declined to
take a report at all, aroused my suspicions. Then
when I was conducted to her apartment, Miss Chalmers
remained there refusing to allow me a moment
alone with my patroness. I was forced to tell
the details of the situation to her, she apparently
being as familiar with the history of the case as I
was, perhaps more so. I observed that while Miss
de Barryos was evidently listening intently to all
that I was saying, she was suppressing all evidence
of it, therefore betraying to me the fact that she
did not wish Miss Chalmers to share her feeling upon
the subject, and further, that she was evidently
striving to appear more ill than she really was,
though Heaven knows it was bad enough. I concluded,
therefore, that her quiet was the result of
acting in the presence of Miss Chalmers."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span></p>

<p>"Which it was!" cried Carlita, earnestly, turning
toward him again.</p>

<p>"I therefore concluded that, as I had been denied
admission and then permitted to see her under Miss
Chalmers' espionage, that Miss de Barryos was kept
a prisoner."</p>

<p>"A prisoner!" cried Leith, a flash in his gray eyes
that was dangerous.</p>

<p>"It is quite true!" exclaimed Carlita, excitedly.</p>

<p>"It does not take a detective long to jump at a
conclusion under those circumstances," said Stolliker,
with a smile. "I then questioned my niece,
Ahbel, who is Miss de Barryos' maid, and had my
suspicions confirmed. I instructed her that she was
to closely watch Miss Chalmers, and report to me,
through a medium which I named to her, any movement
made by Miss Chalmers. Before that, however,
Miss Chalmers insisted upon knowing what
time the train from Albany would arrive, and what
time the arrest would be made. As I did not trust
her, naturally I did not tell the exact truth. At ten
minutes before eight I was notified that Miss Chalmers
had left the house. At eight, I knew that she
had entered this one."</p>

<p>"This one!" gasped Carlita. "Jessica has been
here?"</p>

<p>"Yes," answered Leith. "I will tell you everything
in a moment. Go on, Mr. Stolliker. Your
story interests me."</p>

<p>"I had instructed my niece, Ahbel, that she was
to induce the nurse to leave Miss de Barryos alone
with her for a moment, using any means that lay
in her power, and this injunction also she carried
out. She had Miss Chalmers' own maid summon
her, then when Miss de Barryos was alone, Ahbel
went into the room. Miss de Barryos knows the
rest. She told her maid that it was a matter of life
and death that she should leave the house at once,
and instructed by me, that Miss de Barryos was to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
carry out any wish she might express, Ahbel quickly
threw a dress over her negligee, and&mdash;Perhaps
you can tell the sequel of the story better than I
can, Mr. Pierrepont," exclaimed the detective, with
a merry twinkle in his penetrating eye. "At all
events, when this telegram was received, I knew
where to find her, though I confess I thought she
had come for the purpose of thwarting some scheme
of Miss Chalmers', and I wanted no harm to befall
her."</p>

<p>Leith extended his hand, and with cordial warmth
the detective took it.</p>

<p>"I thank you!" he exclaimed in the old way that
charmed men and women alike. "You might have
worked great harm to me, but you did it in her interest.
You have been her friend, and I can harbor
nothing against you after that, even if I would. She
has had few enough of them, poor child."</p>

<p>"I am glad to have served her, and still more
glad that I have been saved the unhappiness which
this cruel mistake would have given me if it had
gone further. If I may be permitted to congratulate
you both, sir, I will retire. May I have a few
minutes' conversation with you in the morning?
There is the treachery of Meriaz to be considered.
Perjury is no light offense in this country, particularly
when a foreigner plots against the life of a
United States citizen."</p>

<p>"Very well. In the morning at ten. It will give
us both time to think the matter over. If you will
have the kindness to send Miss de Barryos' maid
here with a satchel containing the requisites of a
lady's toilet you will add to the favor you have already
done."</p>

<p>"It will give me pleasure," returned Stolliker,
shaking the hand Carlita extended.</p>

<p>Then he and the Mexican officer, who had been a
silent and non-comprehensive witness of the scene,
left the room together.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span></p>

<p>Leith opened his arms and Carlita flew into them.</p>

<p>"My darling," he whispered, "the clouds lasted
but a few moments with me, and yet I seem to have
suffered for years. What must not all this cruel
time have cost you? Sweet one, believing me a
murderer, how is it possible that you could have
loved me?"</p>

<p>"Don't ask me!" she cried, shivering in his embrace.
"Don't ask me. How is it possible that you
could love me after all my treachery? I accepted
you, held you near me, allowed you even to kiss
my lips, in order that I might betray you to the
gallows. Was it not the kiss of Judas?"</p>

<p>"The kiss that weakened through love," he answered,
drawing her even closer. "Ah, darling, in
spite of all, even the treachery you aver, you could
have offered me no greater proof of your love than
you have done tonight. Do you think that I can
ever forget that you would have sacrificed all the
years of your life in order to bring forgetfulness to
a murderer? Do you think I can forget that you
would have shared my exile, with the promise that
no word of unfaith should ever escape you? The
Good Book says: 'Greater love hath no man than
this, that he give his life for his friend.' But that
was more than life, Carlita. It was hope and honor
and life as well. What suffering would I not have
endured to know you love me like this?"</p>

<p>She allowed him to soothe her and kiss her trembling
lips to quiet, murmuring as he did so:</p>

<p>"Thank God you did not die the night you saved
the child from drowning before I had obtained
your forgiveness. I should have gone mad through
grief and remorse if I had heard this story too late."</p>

<p>"Then you really offered that five thousand for
my life in order that you might have me punished,
as you thought I deserved?"</p>

<p>"No! Upon my soul, no! I was not so bad as
that. It was the first time I had fully realized the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
strength and breadth of my love for you. It was
the first time I knew that all my whole being was
infolded in yours, and it was for my own life I
offered the reward, as well as yours. It was not of
vengeance that I thought then, but only love&mdash;only
love!"</p>

<p>"My darling!" he murmured, tenderly. "Then
it was not all truth she told."</p>

<p>"She? Who?"</p>

<p>"Jessica."</p>

<p>"She is here?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Where?"</p>

<p>With his arm about her, he crossed the room,
turned the key in the lock, and threw open the door,
behind which Jessica stood.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXVI" id="CHAPTER_XXXVI">CHAPTER XXXVI.</a></h2>


<p>Did you ever observe the devilish glare in the
eyes of a caged hyena, the fiendish, cat-like grin
upon his repulsive mouth when he knows he is denied
the prey he covets? There is no other animal
in captivity or out that has the same expression of
countenance, the same half-cringing, diabolical treachery
both in face and the sidelong movement of his
body.</p>

<p>Just such an expression Jessica wore when Leith
threw open the door which separated him from her.
There was no other egress from the room than
through that door or he would not have found her
there; but she came forward after a moment of
profoundest silence throwing up her head defiantly,
the hateful grin receiving sound in a discordant
laughter.</p>

<p>"Well," she exclaimed, lightly, approaching the
mantel-shelf carelessly and taking up the gloves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
she had thrown there, "I have played&mdash;and lost.
Others have done so before, better players than I,
too, perhaps. You think you will escape the crime
you have committed? Ha! ha! A forged telegram
to a minion of the law is not a difficult thing, and I
shall know how to discover the forgery. My hand
is not quite played out, you see. Because Miss de
Barryos loved the murderer of her former lover is
no reason why he should escape the punishment of
his crime. She has evidently been as anxious to
pay out her money to have him escape as she once
was to secure his conviction, but even forged telegrams
are traceable, and I shall know where to find
him when I want him."</p>

<p>"You will not have far to look," said Leith
quietly.</p>

<p>"If it were to the ends of the earth, I should find
you and your half-breed wife, your&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Silence!" exclaimed Leith, the first gleam of
anger coming to his eyes. "Not a word of disrespect
to her. As for myself, I do not care. You
are so powerless as to be almost pitiable. I understand
perfectly the detestable part you have played&mdash;the
false friend, endeavoring to poison the mind
of innocence, the serpent creeping through the grass
at nightfall in your effort to work harm and ruin.
I have known all along that you were striving to
harm Miss de Barryos, from the very first day that
I met her under your disreputable roof."</p>

<p>Jessica laughed aloud&mdash;a laugh that would have
slain had the power been given her.</p>

<p>"You were not loath to visit it, in spite of its
being disreputable!" she exclaimed, sneeringly. "You
never neglected an invitation. Where was the first
place you went upon your return from India? In
whose box did you linger longest at the opera? At
whose side were you content to sit from morning
until night, until she came with her cursed Indian
beauty? Your vaunted virtue is of very recent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
birth! Do you forget that I know the story of Lena
Moore?"</p>

<p>"How dare you mention that name&mdash;here!" thundered
Leith, the passion of his tone frightening her.
Then, remembering himself, he continued, more
quietly: "As you said but now, my dear Jessica,
you have played and lost. Why not retire gracefully
from the table? You have done all the harm
you can. Even the shameless story you would have
repeated but now would not shake the faith of my
promised wife&mdash;would not kill the love she bears
me. But I do not propose that you shall pollute
her pure ears with the story of a folly long since
dead&mdash;the folly of a mere boy in the hands of a designing
woman&mdash;but one which ended before harm
was done. And now, go! Say to your mother that
her ward is under the protection of her betrothed
husband, and safe. I should be inclined to pity
you but for the wrong done to this sweet and inoffensive
child."</p>

<p>Jessica's lips curled scornfully.</p>

<p>"Pity me!" she repeated. "Why? Because you
think I love you? Upon my word, your vanity
blinds you, indeed! It was only your money that I
craved&mdash;only the wealth with which you could surround
me&mdash;only the position in which you could
have placed me. After all, it is not so flattering to
a man's vanity that it need incite his pity."</p>

<p>"And you would have married a murderer&mdash;gone
into voluntary exile&mdash;for wealth and position?"</p>

<p>It was rather a mean thing for him to say, when
he knew so well that it was only the excuse of a
baffled woman; but it was very human, and he was
only that. There was a half-amused, half-disgusted
smile upon his lips that angered her more than a
volume of words could have done. She bit her lips
to prevent the flow of demoniacal fury that possessed
her, then calmly drew on her gloves.</p>

<p>"Good-evening!" she exclaimed, carelessly. "When<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
you have convinced Carlita of the truth of your
statement regarding Lena Moore, and have succeeded
in convincing the world that the forged telegram
from Mexico was genuine, then, perhaps, I
may congratulate you; but until then I shall reserve
my good wishes for your future. It will not
strengthen the story you wish to palm upon the
public that my mother's ward left her roof for the
shelter of yours before she became your wife, and
that privilege my mother will contest, as you may
remember Carlita is not yet of age."</p>

<p>Without so much as a glance toward Carlita, but
with a stately bow in Leith's direction, she opened
the door from behind and stepped out closing it
upon herself.</p>

<p>Then she went downstairs swiftly, not waiting
for the elevator, and into the street, her eyes blinded,
her brain in a seething whirl of torturing madness.</p>

<p>Her turn had come at last!</p>

<p>She hailed a carriage and gave the address to the
coachman incoherently, then sprang in and closed the
door upon herself, eager to shut out the very sight of
the world.</p>

<p>"Balked!" she muttered, fiercely. "Baffled just
when success seemed within my grasp! Curse them&mdash;curse
them both! I have plotted and planned for
nothing. I have betrayed my unhappy mother into
the power of that wretch Meriaz, and what have I
gained? Nothing! Nothing except that he loves
her more than ever. I have proven to him the very
depth and power of her love while striving to
demonstrate mine. I have placed her upon the
very pinnacle I would have given my soul to occupy.
And what have I gained? His hatred&mdash;his
contempt&mdash;his bitter loathing! I have shut myself
out from his presence eternally! And I loved him
so! My God! I loved him so!"</p>

<p>She covered her face with her hands, and a wild
storm of weeping burst from her, so overpowering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
that she did not know when the carriage had
stopped, did not know when the coachman climbed
down from his box and spoke to her, did not hear
until he touched her lightly upon the arm.</p>

<p>She scarcely remembered afterward how it was
she got into the house; but she found her mother
standing in the hall upon her entrance, looking
like a wraith, in her white gown, with her still
whiter face gleaming above it.</p>

<p>"Meriaz has come for his answer," she groaned,
speaking the words almost before the door had been
closed upon her daughter&mdash;"Meriaz has come for
his answer! For the love of Heaven, tell me what
I am to say?"</p>

<p>"Tell him," cried Jessica, bending forward, and
curiously speaking the words through her set teeth&mdash;"tell
him that he lied! That Leith Pierrepont is
not guilty of murder! Tell him that news has come
from the South, and Leith is free! Tell him that
which he knows but too well, that it was his own
daughter who was the murderess!"</p>

<p>No cry from the lips of woman ever equaled in
mortal anguish that which fell from Mrs. Chalmers.
She staggered back against the wall, her eyes wild
in their insane rolling.</p>

<p>"His daughter!" she gasped. "Muriel Meriaz!"</p>

<p>"If that is her name," returned Jessica, sullenly.
"You appear to know her better than I. Yes, she
is the murderess. But what is that to you, or me,
that you should turn the hue of death itself? What
is that to you, or me, that you should gasp and
moan as if you yourself were facing the gallows?
We have lost our game; but I don't see why you
should agonize over the daughter of a scoundrel
like that&mdash;a creature whom you never saw; a&mdash;"</p>

<p>She was looking so intently at her mother that
she did not see a man's form come into the hall,
did not know of his presence there until his hard,
iron fingers closed upon her arm; then she turned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
and looked into the scowling face of Manuel Meriaz.</p>

<p>"Shut up!" he commanded, brutally. "You don't
know what you are talking about, my fine lady. I'll
teach you some day to call your own father a scoundrel.
I'll teach you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What are you saying?"</p>

<p>"That which is true. You never heard the story,
did you? You thought only that I was familiar with
a small slice of the past history of your family,
but it never occurred to you that the Mexican whom
you detested, in spite of all your expressions to the
contrary, was in reality your own father. And this
girl whom you have called a murderess is your sister!
Do you hear that, my girl?"</p>

<p>"You are mad&mdash;mad!" panted Jessica.</p>

<p>Meriaz laughed aloud.</p>

<p>"Look in your mother's face and see if I am mad.
Look in her face and ask her if I have lied. Look
in her face and bid her tell you that I am not your
father. Aha! you dare not, because you know I
have spoken the truth. You are my daughter, and
as such I propose that you shall be regarded in the
future. You understand?"</p>

<p>But Jessica did not reply. She stood there for a
moment, looking straight at him in a stunned, stupid
silence; then, with never a word, she walked by
him and up the stairs without a glance in her
mother's direction, without a word of sympathy,
without a thought for any one save herself, and up
to her own room.</p>

<p>She closed the door behind her, and stood with
her back against it for some time, then with a defiant
gesture threw up her head and walked swiftly to her
writing desk. She sat down and wrote hurriedly:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My Dear Dudley</span>,&mdash;A week ago you asked me
to be your wife&mdash;swore you could not live without
me. If it was the truth you spoke, if you meant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
the vows you swore that day, answer this note in
person. I must see you at once.</p>

<p class="sig0">
"Ever faithfully,</p>
<p class="sig1">
"<span class="smcap">Jessica.</span>"<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>She sealed it, the smile half triumphant, half defiant
still lingering upon her lips, called a messenger,
and dispatched it at once to Dudley Maltby.</p>

<p>"Tomorrow morning," she muttered, "the papers
shall contain the announcement of my marriage to
the scion of one of the noblest houses in all America.
Leith Pierrepont shall see that his power to hurt
me was not so great as he thought, and I shall be
saved from that beast, Meriaz."</p>

<p>She did not consider what was to befall her
mother, did not think of her future at all, never
even remembered her, but consumed the time of
the messenger's absence in planning what she should
say to Dudley Maltby, her lips curling with scorn
as she imagined his joy at receiving her message.</p>

<p>She smiled grimly as she saw the messenger returning
with a note in his hand, and received it
with the calmest indifference, dismissing the boy with
a haughtily murmured:</p>

<p>"That will do!"</p>

<p>Then, when he had gone, she tore the envelope
from the missive, pausing to light a cigarette nonchalantly
before she read it. She looked at it quite
calmly, but the expression of her face changed curiously
as she read:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My Dear Jessica</span>,&mdash;You were wiser that day
than I. I allowed my passion to carry me away,
never pausing to think of the future, after the manner
of all hot-headed lovers; but with your usual
clear-sightedness and brilliancy of intellect you foresaw
what the future would hold for us with barely
ten thousand a year to drag us through a monotonous
existence, and you laughed at my earnestness.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
You were quite right. Don't think for a moment that
I am upbraiding you. On the contrary, I realize
that you have done us both a great service, that the
proposition I made would have been sheerest madness.
Of course I understand that pity for me
prompted your kind note, and I thank you from the
bottom of my heart, but it is much better that I
should not see you just at present. Thanking you
for many happy hours in the past, believe me,</p>

<p class="sig0">
"Very cordially yours,</p>
<p class="sig1">
"<span class="smcap">Dudley Maltby.</span>"<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>She tore it up without any show of indignation
whatever, and threw it into the waste basket, then
rang for her maid.</p>

<p>"Is Manuel Meriaz still here?" she asked.</p>

<p>"No, ma'am," her maid replied. "He left half
an hour ago, and&mdash;and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"He was arrested as he went down the stoop."</p>

<p>"Umph! I am going to my mother. She is in
her room?"</p>

<p>"Yes, ma'am."</p>

<p>"You may pack my clothing for a rather long
absence, and tell Mathilde to do the same for my
mother. We leave on Wednesday for Paris."</p>

<p>Her maid's exclamation of surprise was lost upon
her. She was looking mechanically through the window.</p>

<p>"At least one fortunate thing has happened,"
she was musing. "But for the arrest of Meriaz we
might have had difficulty in getting away. Now it
will be quite easy. I shall require my mother's
services, and so silence concerning the past is best,
I suppose. I shall only tell her of the death of&mdash;of&mdash;this
girl. If Dudley Maltby, my last hope, had
not failed me, I need never have seen her again, but
now&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span></p>

<p>A shrug of the shoulders, intended to convince
herself of her indifference, but failing signally, completed
the sentence.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXVII" id="CHAPTER_XXXVII">CHAPTER XXXVII.</a></h2>


<p>The transferment of the guardianship of Carlita
from Mrs. Chalmers to Pierrepont was not a difficult
thing, and he lost no time in making the application
for it.</p>

<p>Nor was there loss of time in the matter of their
marriage.</p>

<p>She had no friends whatever in that section of
country, and so they were married quietly with
only Dudley Maltby as best man and Ahbel and
Stolliker as witnesses, and left, while April was yet
in its infancy, for a long cruise upon the "Eolus,"
accompanied only by Ahbel and Leith's valet, besides
the crew.</p>

<p>Carlita is a great favorite with the men, one reason
being, perhaps, that she divided five thousand
dollars between the two who brought Leith and his
little half-dead burden safely back to her when death
was threatening both.</p>

<p>The child did not die, nor yet did the mother in
whose interests he had received his wetting, but
there is a man upon the "Eolus" who would sacrifice
his life at any time for its owner, who risked
his own for a crippled boy.</p>

<p>They are very happy. So happy that a little anxious
cloud gathered between Carlita's brows as she
lay in her favorite nook upon the deck, her couch
being the one she had used upon the day of that
momentous little cruise that occupied less than one
brief day, and yet seemed to have turned the current
of all her life.</p>

<p>"What is it, sweetheart?" Leith asked, no shade
of expression upon that lovely face lost to him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span></p>

<p>"I was only thinking of the old days," she answered,
looking up in his face with a devotion that
would have banished the most unhappy memories.
"Of some words my mother spoke to me before she
died, of a curse&mdash;"</p>

<p>"A curse!" interrupted Leith, lightly. "How
very romantic! Do let us hear all about it."</p>

<p>"You needn't laugh," returned Carlita, allowing
him to draw her very closely in the shelter of his
arms. "It was serious enough, Heaven knows! It
was the curse of Pocahontas. Jessica told you once
that I was half Indian. While the component parts
weren't exactly correct, the essence of the statement
was true. There is the blood of the Indian girl in
my veins through the maternal side."</p>

<p>"And a very noble girl she was," exclaimed
Leith. "I'm sure John Smith the first would bear
me out if he were here to speak for himself."</p>

<p>"Her marriage to John Rolfe, you know, was
most unhappy. The only issue of the marriage
was a son, but on her death bed, Pocahontas pronounced
a curse upon his female descendants who
should bear the trace of the Indian in her appearance."</p>

<p>"How very thoughtless of her. When it was
John Rolfe who made her so unhappy, why couldn't
she have made it the male descendants?"</p>

<p>"History sayeth not," returned Carlita, her humor
lightened in spite of herself. "But it is a matter of
fact that every dark member of my mother's family
has suffered through that curse."</p>

<p>"But I have not heard what it was yet?"</p>

<p>"And I can't tell you the words; but the meaning
was that if she dared love she should suffer
ruin and death, either she or the man whom she
cursed with her devotion. I told that curse to&mdash;Olney,
Leith, when he was leaving for Mexico."</p>

<p>"And you really believe that is what caused your
suffering and his death?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span></p>

<p>She did not reply, but looked out dreamily over
the water.</p>

<p>"What nonsense, darling wife!" he said, gently.
"You don't suppose that God would grant a mere
foolish, wretched woman the power to curse the innocent
of future generations, do you? You don't
suppose that He would bring a helpless infant into
the world for predestined misery because some half-crazed
creature in her blind ignorance uttered a
speech that was superinduced perhaps by a grief
too great to be borne in silence? Where would be
the justice, and mercy, and wisdom of that? And
what is your idea of God if not inseparable from
those qualities which form His divine attribute?"</p>

<p>"You make me ashamed."</p>

<p>"Not ashamed, love, because you never really
believed in it. It was only that the foolish repetition
made you anxious. There is no channel without
its turning point, dear, no life without its sorrow,
and when yours came, you saw in it the curse
which that poor, wretched woman uttered, and which
others were foolish enough to repeat, that was all.
In our love and belief in the goodness of God, we
can afford to laugh at such nonsense as that, my
darling. Promise me that you will forget it."</p>

<p>She gave the promise with her lips upon his, belief
and faith and perfect love casting out fear.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, when her own little one was born,
less than two years after, and she was told that it
was an exquisite girl, her first question was:</p>

<p>"What is her complexion?"</p>

<p>"As fair as a lily," the nurse replied. "Her eyes
are porcelain blue, her hair is like the sun."</p>

<p>And the sweet face upon the pillow flushed with
pleasure and relief as she gazed up into the eyes of
her husband, and murmured faintly:</p>

<p>"Thank God, Leith, there is no trace of the Indian
there!"</p>
